PAUL LEWIS: Hello, folks, and
welcome to the second season

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.500
of the "Developer Diary."

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.680
The first one, I built the
Chrome Dev Summit site.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.850
This time, I'm going to be
building a video media app.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.780
So expect things like
Chromecast support,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.820
expect things like
adaptive streaming,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.860
expect things like service
workers and offline media.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.840
There's gonna be loads.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.137
Clearly, there's
going to be loads.

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:29.220
But what I thought I'd do
in this particular entry

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.710
is just show you
around the design.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.400
So in the past
little while, I've

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.950
been working on the designs.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.970
I'm not a designer.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.300
So I just sort of
play at design,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.100
and I'm now going to
show you what I designed.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.000
So there we go.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.530
That's me.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.981
That's what I do apparently.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:48.480
Right.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.086
On my screen, then let's
have a look what we've got.

00:00:51.086 --> 00:00:51.960
Let me show you this.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.710
This is quite interesting.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.080
I mean, I think it's
quite interesting.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.580
I guess you do too because you
got this far into the video.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.080
Right.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.300
These are the icons.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.709
Now, you might be like, why
has he got so many icons?

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.000
The answer is this top one, this
kind of greeny-turquoisey one,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.709
that's what I'm currently
going with as the default icon,

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:14.875
probably the one that gets
added to the home screen.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.330
And then below it,
this purple one.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.509
Let me explain.

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.050
The problem with
the turquoisey-green

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.480
is what if you get
some poster frame

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.944
for video that's really orangey
or just a really different

00:01:31.944 --> 00:01:33.360
color, something
that would really

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.890
clash with that turquoise.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.850
So I thought well, I'll
tell you what we'll do.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.960
We'll just change
the color scheme

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.130
of the site, the icons, and
everything else to just match.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.260
So I've been working on some
code, which I'll show you soon,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.530
that does a thing called
median cut, which is just

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.800
a way of slicing and dicing
the colors from an image

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.785
so that you get a
representative palette,

00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:00.540
a representative
sample from that image.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.279
It's not that complex to
understand or even to do,

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:05.820
but it seems to work
out pretty well.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.354
Anyway, so I thought if the
album art picture, post frame--

00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:10.770
I don't know what
to call it, it's

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.020
got loads of different names--

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.130
but if the picture
that represents a video

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.167
is this purply one
here, which looks

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:18.250
to be the Millennium Bridge
in London looking over

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.834
to Saint Paul's
Cathedral, if it's that,

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:23.000
then it's a more purply one.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.420
You can see the icon's purply.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.250
Then this flamingo that
is not doing the flamenco.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.400
But if it was, it would be
a flamingo doing a flamenco.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.910
This bright orange
flamingo, that gives us

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.390
this kind of orangey look.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.520
Bottom one arguably
should be a bit bluer,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.480
but the code came up with
these kind of grayish colors.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.459
So that's what I kind
of opted for for now.

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.500
I'll probably adjust the
code as it goes through.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.740
Anyway, icons, they
are going to adapt

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.776
to the content of the site.

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:59.400
So what does the
actual site look like?

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.233
Well, this is what it
looks like on desktop.

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:03.010
Let me zoom in for you here.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.550
Too far, Paul, too far.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.460
Back it up.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.421
There we are.

00:03:06.421 --> 00:03:06.920
Right.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.720
At the top, you can
see there's the icon.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.489
There's basically
a featured video

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.280
with a big play button
in the middle that's

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.466
like, this is the one that
I think you should watch.

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:18.590
And in the top right-hand
corner, if I do sign in--

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.665
not sure I'm going to need to
or want to, see how it goes.

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:25.040
There isn't a big need to,
but it's an opportunity for me

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.057
to try using the
credentials API,

00:03:28.057 --> 00:03:29.640
so that seems like
a good thing to do.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.170
Anyway, we will see how it goes.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.890
If you tap on your
little avatar picture,

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.830
you get a menu there
with the managing

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.520
your downloads, and your
history, and stuff like that.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.720
Star rating, the
name of the show

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.880
and then the episode
underneath it.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.440
Underneath that, we
got some new releases.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.200
There's sort of
thumbnails for those,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.870
whether or not you've watched
a particular one, star rating.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.270
For some reason, I only
bothered putting in the duration

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.860
on the left-hand one.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.810
Obviously, I was having a
lazy day because really it

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.680
should be on all of them.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.830
Oh, well.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.907
So below that, we also have
a kind of marketing area.

00:04:10.907 --> 00:04:13.115
Because, again, if you're
going to build a media app,

00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:14.550
you kind of want
to be like, hey,

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.691
you should add to home
screen and be awesome.

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:19.149
And then below
that, there's just--

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:20.565
I haven't even put
the thumbnails,

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:21.920
didn't even put thumbnails in--

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.650
I just dropped in
a grid placeholder

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.320
for more content that's
going to go here and then

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.510
a footer at the bottom.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.410
So fairly straightforward.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.680
Let me see what else
is worth showing you.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.300
Because you can go
offline, there's

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.310
a version here where
we've said, show me

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.630
only the downloaded ones
only, and then we gray out any

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.340
that you can't play.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.260
We put this banner
at the top that's

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.160
like, I'm only showing
you the downloaded ones.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.150
If you want to see all your
videos, switch off that.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.440
So that grays out all the
ones that you can't see.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.530
Mobile is actually not--

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.150
let me just open up
properly-- mobile

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.720
is not vastly different
really to the desktop.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.906
When I design, I tend
to design desktop first

00:05:08.906 --> 00:05:11.030
because it means that I
think about everything that

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.460
needs to go in there,
and then I think

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.650
about how to fit
that appropriately

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.585
into a mobile space, rather
than starting mobile and adding

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:20.210
features in because
I think that can be

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.419
quite frustrating for people.

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.459
They're like, but you can
do them on the desktop.

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:24.800
Why can't I do that on a phone?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.680
So that tends to be
how I do the design.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.700
I actually build mobile first,
but I design desktop first.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.010
Whatever.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.510
Right.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.551
What else can I show you?

00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:39.580
Oh, the video player.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.180
The actual video player,
that's where all the fun

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.300
stuff is probably going
to be hiding, I imagine.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.029
This is what it looks like.

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.570
We could zoom that
down a little bit.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.390
It's a bit big.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.402
So we have video playing.

00:05:53.402 --> 00:05:54.360
There's a Close button.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.040
There's a skipping back
and forwards by 30 seconds.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.395
I might see how that feels.

00:05:59.395 --> 00:06:01.020
Thirty seconds might
be a bit too much.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.580
I don't know.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.590
Pause/play, big one in
the middle, but also

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.881
a small one if your thumb is
down in the bottom corner,

00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:08.280
you might want to just tap that.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.020
A time slider scrubbing
thing that moves you further

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.010
into the video.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.980
Volume control,
that may or may not

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.470
pan out because on a mobile,
you tend to, I think,

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.740
do you tap that button?

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.257
Would you or would you just
use the phone's volume?

00:06:25.257 --> 00:06:27.090
I think you probably
use the phone's volume.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.260
I'm not sure about that one.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.240
Full screen, again,
on something like iOS,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.460
you'd probably have
full screen by default

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.340
if you tapped on a video.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.840
I'm pretty sure
that's what it still

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.130
does, whereas other ones
might be in line playback.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.640
I guess we'll see how that goes.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.280
Taking the video, making
available offline is grand.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.250
And then a Chromecast button.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.770
Gonna be fun adding
Chromecast support.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.080
There's actually,
I think, two ways

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.480
to do it, which is interesting.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.710
I think the presentation
API, and then there's

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.410
the remote playback API.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.730
Wow, we've got
fun stuff to come.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.990
Anyway, so that's
playing videos.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.170
So hopefully you see the kind of
thing that I'm trying to build.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.960
Think of any video
playback service,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.820
like video on-demand
playback service.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.730
It's that kind of app basically.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.230
Cool.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.480
Right.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.896
I'm going to stop it there
because I don't want to take up

00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:24.935
too much of your time.

00:07:24.935 --> 00:07:26.310
I think in the
next entry, what I

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.260
want to do is I want to
talk a little bit more

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.420
about video formats and just
what I've discovered so far

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.360
about how video
playback can be done.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.590
It's interesting.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.360
It's definitely
much more involved

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.236
than I thought it
was going to be.

00:07:44.236 --> 00:07:45.950
[NERVOUS LAUGHTER]

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.810
See you then.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.310
Hey, folks, if you're upset
that this video has finished,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.300
don't worry.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.130
There's more.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.270
They're about here.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.587
And you can click on them,
and then they'll start,

00:07:55.587 --> 00:07:56.920
and then there'll be more video.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.840
And at the end of
that, you'll probably

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.298
see me at the end
going, if you are

00:07:59.298 --> 00:08:02.090
disappointed that this video
is finished, then there's more.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.419
And you can do that
all day everyday.

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:06.960
Or if you decide to not do that
all day everyday and you want

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.740
to subscribe, there's a
button kind of here-ish

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.650
you should click.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.316
And then you'll always
get notified when

00:08:12.316 --> 00:08:13.490
we put stuff on the channel.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.890
Ah, brilliant.
