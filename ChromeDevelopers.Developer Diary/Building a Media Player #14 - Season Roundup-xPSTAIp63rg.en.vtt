PAUL LEWIS: Hey,
look, so I just wanted

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.710
to record a final
video on this media

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.540
PWA to say thank you for coming
along on this journey with me.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.250
When I think about
where I started,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.760
it was that I knew
nothing about media,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.850
and I know enough
now to be dangerous

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.030
and have hopefully taught
you to do the same.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.190
OK, that didn't sound
quite like I intended.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.690
Nonetheless, thank you very
much for coming on this journey,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.740
and let's think about
kind of what's in here.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.490
What did we cover?

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.540
We covered service worker,
caches, dash and MSE, HLS,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.330
background fetch, intersection
observers, readable streams,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.880
media session API, IDB, full
screen, orientation lock,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.330
and device orientation and
just general PWA goodness.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.890
So if you've not
caught the videos,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.390
definitely go back
and watch those.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.250
Definitely check
out the source code.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.509
Have a read through,
all that stuff.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:56.550
Ask your questions below.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.180
I do read them, and I
really enjoy the chat

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.060
that we can have
about all this stuff.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.409
But hopefully,
it's also inspired

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:07.950
you to maybe go and
try something new

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.380
that you've not tried before.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.230
It's a great
opportunity, if you can,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.220
to discover a brand new part of
the web and just give it a go.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.170
So with that, I want
to say thank you again

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.400
and I will catch you--

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.730
whatever I end up next--

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.634
hang on, hang on.

00:01:22.634 --> 00:01:23.550
Got to say this right.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.930
Whatever I end up
building next--

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.490
that's what I meant to say--

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.692
I will catch you when I do that.

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:30.237
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:31.570
Hey, folks, thanks for watching.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.195
Don't forget that
there is more content

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:35.430
that you can find
kind of over here-ish

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.890
and if you want to subscribe,
there's probably a button,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.690
I don't know, maybe there,
maybe somewhere around there.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.380
Click that if you've
not done that.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.290
Brilliant!
