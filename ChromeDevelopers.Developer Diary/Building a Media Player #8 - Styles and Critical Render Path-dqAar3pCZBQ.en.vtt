PAUL LEWIS: Right, so
I got quite a lot done

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.100
at [? Blincon ?] in
between all the talks

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.450
and chatting to everybody
else and all that stuff.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.360
So this is just me
wanting to catch you

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.340
up to where I've actually got to
by this point, which is mostly

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.379
that a lot of the very
basic styling is in place.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.930
And I think I mentioned
right at the start

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.350
that I will design
desktop first and then--

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.430
build mobile first.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.950
So, what I tend to do when
I'm actually building,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.035
you see it on the screen.

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:29.160
I do have a little bit more
work to do around this,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580
but you know, this is
what it is at the moment.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.570
I actually quite like
working this way just

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.860
because I find it pretty fast.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.100
You can use the
responsive-- the device

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.839
toolbar and responsive
mode in that.

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.880
I actually find that I
get on pretty well by just

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.790
dragging the window
out, in and out.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.690
And I will start with
the 320 normally,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
because that tends to be
the size of an iPhone,

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.410
and that's where
I tend to start.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.200
And basically drag
out until it breaks,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.059
and then add in the break point.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.100
You probably see there
are a couple of specific--

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.200
there's one break point
now, where we go from--

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.640
the new releases go from being
a two by two grid to a four

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.930
by one grid.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.020
And the descriptions start
to appear just beneath.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.150
That's a bit tight,
isn't it, actually?

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.410
Nonetheless, it works.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.310
It's just about
there, just about OK.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.680
You see as well that this
little marketing type

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.759
blurb that I added in is also--

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.550
there you go, that
switches there, as well.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.120
So I just basically
have been working my way

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.100
through the breakpoints
and just going,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.660
yeah, that looks about right,
yeah, that looks not so good,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.020
or whatever.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.640
The other thing that's pretty
cool is the color scheme stuff.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.940
I mean, I mentioned this
before that I was going to--

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.620
I the code that
did the median cut.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.150
Yeah?

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.920
If you haven't seen that, I
think that was number three?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.810
Entry number three?

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.700
Feel like it is three,
maybe it was two.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.290
Three.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.820
Two.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.850
Three, three, OK.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.040
If I-- let me just
grab my style and if I

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.990
say, text content
on the style, you

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.550
see here that I actually
have a lot of inline styles

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.600
for the home page.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.490
I should say that,
just for the home page.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.520
Because when you
hit the home page

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.124
I want to make sure that the
styles are ready to go really

00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:13.290
quickly because that's where
I think most people are

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.850
going to land on the site.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.690
For the other pages, I actually
put the styles in as a link,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.539
but for the home page
I do it inline so

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:22.830
that it gets there pretty fast.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.320
And there's a difference
in what's sent inline, just

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.210
for the home page,
and what I put

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.030
for the whole app, or chunks
of the app, into the links.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.590
But it is our way to do it.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.767
So anyway, I've got a
lot of set up styles here

00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:37.350
that's just designed to get you
up and running really quickly.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.670
But at the end of that--

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.230
and Devtools doesn't
show it actually.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.440
It truncates, if you see here.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.179
It puts the ellipses,
dot dot dot.

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.220
So you actually have to
ask for the text content.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.020
You can see here, I bake out
the primary color as background,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.556
as color.

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:54.930
And I do the same for the
light color, a secondary color,

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.120
a tertiary color,
and a quaternary.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.410
And those come from that
code, the median cut code

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.690
that I mentioned in
the previous episode.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.760
So I'm baking those
into the page.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.374
And then, when it's something
like the title here,

00:03:09.374 --> 00:03:11.790
I can say that the title should
be the primary light color

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.330
as a class.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.400
Now, I would have much preferred
to use custom CSS variables.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.720
You know, dash
dash primary color,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.980
and then just set
that in the CSS

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.510
based off what I
perceive these to be.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.060
I can't do that because they're
not supported everywhere,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.820
and they're not easily poly
filled as I understand.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.880
But in any case, it felt
like I just couldn't quite

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.770
get there to use them yet.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.270
So that's why, if you're
wondering why I've not

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.100
popped it in as a CSS variable.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.720
That's why.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.710
Just because compact, mostly.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.850
And that's it, really.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.100
So, as I say-- oh,
here's this little bit

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.296
of a thing going on here.

00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:55.920
When you roll over
these images, I just

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.930
do a little bit of a scale,
and there's a little shadow

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.120
that pops out just beneath.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.220
That's a pseudo element that
I just fade and slide down.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.900
That's it.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.650
A bit of opacity and
a bit of a transform.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.100
You've heard me say,
probably too many times,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.680
but I feel like
you can never say

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.540
too many times, except for
when I say it too many times.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.210
That if you stick to
transform and opacity,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.750
performance will be pretty good.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.910
I have a little transform
and opacity thing,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.993
let me just rephrase this.

00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:22.410
Watch the poster image here.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.850
A little face and zoom.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.580
Fade and zoom.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.590
Opacity and transform.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.500
Scale and opacity.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.390
I think nice little
touches like that,

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.630
I think, they're fun to add and
they add quite a lot of life

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.800
to what you're building.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.050
But just showing you the coolest
thing, if I go to this one,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.049
you see it's picked out
the purple colors, which

00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:41.420
is not a surprise when you
look at that photo, is it.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.170
And I have way more
to do here because all

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.920
I've got at the moment
is the description.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.550
There should be the
make available offline.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.600
We should have being
able to Chromecast,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.540
all sorts of things.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.414
So I've got loads of
work to do, but the kind

00:04:54.414 --> 00:04:56.910
of very, very basic
styling is now

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.960
in place, which is fabulous.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.060
So take a look around.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.310
The code will link to it
the description below,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.220
and I'll catch you well,
next time on it, eh?

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.230
Yeah.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.240
Brilliant.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.170
I'm going to stop talking now.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.240
How many times can I
sign off this video?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.020
One more?

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.510
Yes.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.557
Toodaloo.

00:05:16.557 --> 00:05:17.890
Hey, folks, thanks for watching.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.515
Don't forget that
there is more content

00:05:19.515 --> 00:05:22.456
that you can find over
here-ish, and if you

00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:24.830
want to subscribe there's
probably a button I don't know,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.636
maybe there.

00:05:25.636 --> 00:05:27.030
Maybe somewhere around there.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.960
Click that if you've
not done that.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.810
Brilliant.
