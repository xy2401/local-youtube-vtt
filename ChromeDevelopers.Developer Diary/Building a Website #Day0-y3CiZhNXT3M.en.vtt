PAUL LEWIS: So I had this idea.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.160
Let me backtrack.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.260
I'm building the Chrome Dev
Summit website, and I love it.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.910
I've built it a couple
of times before.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.220
And I love this
bit, because I've

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.396
got all the designs and wire
frames-- I did those myself.

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:19.770
But I'm about to
start the build.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.179
And I was like, well, look.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.720
There may be stuff in there that
people actually want to see.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.160
So why don't I make
these videos where

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.350
I show you what I'm working
on, what's going on.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.950
The code will be going
in to GitHub anyway.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.310
And then if there's things
in there that I'm thinking,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.686
or bugs I find, then I
can record it, share that,

00:00:39.686 --> 00:00:41.560
and we can go on a bit
of a journey together.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.476
So subscribe to the
channel, if you want to.

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:46.850
There will probably
be a playlist

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.210
with just these videos in.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.850
And I will share what I'm doing.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.120
And obviously, you can type in
the comments or whatever else.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.350
And we'll ship the Chrome Dev
Summit 2016 website together,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.510
sort of, with me
doing the coding.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.460
