PAUL LEWIS: Hello, and welcome
to the very first diary entry

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.460
thing-- I think.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.680
So today was actually
the first day

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.390
I actually started coding
on the Dev Summit website.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.580
And actually, it's
been a pretty good day.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.490
I took the stuff
that we did last week

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.030
in the supercharged live
stream-- which was servers,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.781
doing the server-side
rendering, because I

00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:25.988
know I'm going to do a bunch
of server-side rendering

00:00:25.988 --> 00:00:27.480
for the Chrome Dev
Summit website.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.440
What I need to do is I need
to-- in the next time I

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.639
record one of these,
I'll show you the designs

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:34.180
as well so you know
where I'm headed.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.860
For now, I just know I've got
to get infrastructure setup.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.300
So I figure I'll show you
a little bit around what

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.170
I've got going on,
which, as it happens,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.110
will involve looking at
me having written the word

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.210
"index," apparently.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.290
That's as far as I got today.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.000
OK.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.440
I've done more than that.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.130
Let me jump across to the code.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.140
So mostly, mostly,
mostly, mostly, we

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.790
have a travis.yml file set up.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.210
What I've got is, this
is a bunch of stuff

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.935
to download and actually
host the App Engine thing.

00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:07.512
I'm also installing Lighthouse
because it's a progressive web

00:01:07.512 --> 00:01:08.890
app, or it's going to be one.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.145
I want to make sure that I'm
doing the progressive wep

00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:11.790
appy things.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.160
And that's exactly what
Lighthouse can do for me.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.135
So I have Lighthouse.

00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:17.060
It then gets a copy of Chrome.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.140
It starts that up.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.450
And then I basically
ask it to run Lighthouse

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.550
against the Dev Summit site.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.060
And then I basically do a bit
of a quick validation, which

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.710
I will show you is in here.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.490
And all I'm really doing
is I open up the JSON file

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.060
that Lighthouse is spitting out.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.800
And then I have
a look through it

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.540
and basically look at the
progressive web app bits.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.533
And I just add it
up and divide it.

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:47.000
And if I'm below 0.8,
I just fail the build.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.019
And because I've got a manifest
in there, which I'll show you,

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:52.560
and because I've
got a service worker

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.340
in there, which I'll show
you, I should be mostly OK.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.620
It will only be if I
break something like that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.055
or if I have a performance
regression maybe-- actually,

00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:06.100
no, that won't be
caught-- I should add

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.350
that in-- that it will throw.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.539
So that was basically that.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.220
And then most of
the day has actually

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.660
gone into the Python stuff.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.640
And it apparently
wants me to install.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.400
Go away.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.960
Right, which mostly is this.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.806
Anything that's Dev Summit
slash whatever, I pick up

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:28.930
and in the GET-- here
we are-- I basically

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.390
look at the URL and grab
whatever I think it is,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.850
which is like if
it's a static file,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.200
I basically grab
that file directly.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.200
Which you can see is--
oh, actually it just

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.960
assumes that it's a
straight one to one match.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.220
And I set those to
cache for a year.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.000
And then if it's
not a static file,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.600
so it doesn't begin with
/static, then I basically,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.780
the moment I serve up
the single index HTML--

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.860
which is almost certainly going
to change to be per section,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.440
but it's fine right now-- and
I set the HTML to not cache.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.520
So while static files
are caching for a year,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.150
public no cache on the HTML
means that the HTML will always

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.010
be revalidated.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.720
And I'll come back to
the hashing in a moment.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.710
And then, if it's
the service worker,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.600
even though I serve it up
from static scripts-- sw.js--

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.250
I want it to appear at
/devsummit so that it can scope

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.960
and control that whole thing.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.800
So that all is working.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.610
Actually, let me show you it
over here on the Network tab,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.500
run that.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.260
Da da-- Dev Summit is--
there's the thing, headers.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.450
It's got an ETag, which I also
set further down in the script.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.670
Public, no cache, which
is exactly what I wanted.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.336
And then there's a
javascript file which

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:44.730
has the max age of a year.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.487
That is pretty
much what I wanted.

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:50.070
And you'll notice, by the way,
that there's this big long hash

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.160
in the file name.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.431
And that is because if it's
going to cache it for a year,

00:03:55.431 --> 00:03:56.680
I need a way to invalidate it.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.090
And if it's always
called, like, cds.js, then

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.830
that's not going to
work out because even

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.620
if I update the file, it will
still use the old cached one.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.960
So I use hashing to make
sure that, if the file

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.210
contents change, the HTML will
get a different path in it.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.390
And then it will basically cause
the file to be redownloaded,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.110
which I do in here.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.269
The footer, you can see
me actually doing it.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.518
I basically take the path
that I'm actually interested

00:04:21.518 --> 00:04:24.100
and I pass it through a
filter called "add hash,"

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.740
which is in the Python.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.460
There we are.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.560
And that basically reads
through the file, updates

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.830
the hash with a SHA 256,
and then substitutes it

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.280
into the file.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.526
So you get cds.blah
blah blah .js.

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:40.900
Not blah blah
blah, what is that?

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.290
And then on the other side,
we basically remove it.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.280
So that goes back down
to cds.js or whatever

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.610
the file is that I'm
actually interested in.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.850
So that means that I've got
kind of built in hashing,

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.100
which is working just great.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.070
So if I change
files, they update.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.550
The last thing I was
going to show you,

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.810
I do have a couple
of started things.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.780
One is the manifest.json,
which is already

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.520
filled out with all the
Chrome Dev Summit stuff,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.940
which is good.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:19.440
And also the service worker,
which is the lightest weight

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.600
service worker that
you can pretty much do,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.940
which skips waiting.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.080
When it gets activated,
it claims all clients

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.067
and on fetch, it
responds with a fetch

00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:29.150
of whatever you asked for.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.660
So it's kind of
like a pass-through.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.810
And I've done this
mostly because I

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.970
wanted to get the
Lighthouse score high enough

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.640
that it would fail the build
if there was a regression.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.850
So it's kind of
like a pass-through.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.540
And I discovered a Chrome
bug in the process.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.736
I should show you the
Chrome bug, right?

00:05:50.736 --> 00:05:52.480
Do you want to see
the Chrome bug?

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.080
All right.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.460
Let me show you the Chrome bug.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.330
I think it's crbug.com 648208.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.160
That's a guess.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.720
I got the ID right!

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.830
I only did that-- ah!

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.825
Basically-- there's a siren.

00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:09.825
There's a siren outside.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.480
That's London.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.980
Right.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.740
I basically discovered
that, if you set a page

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.300
to be offline in Dev
Tools, and then you

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.630
make a request that goes
via a service worker,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.190
the service worker will still
be treated as online, even

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.440
if Dev Tools is set to offline.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.640
I think that's a bit weird.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.000
I think either Chrome should say
that network throttling affects

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.780
only the page and not
anything like a service worker

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.220
or-- and this would
be my preference,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.416
I think-- we extend
the network throttling

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:49.540
to include service workers.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.420
So even if a service
worker makes a request,

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.710
it would be requested with 3G.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.200
Problem is a service worker
can service multiple tabs.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.619
And so which one does it take?

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:03.160
I don't know.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.880
It caught me out.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.790
I filed a bug.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.740
We'll see how that one pans out.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.160
So that's pretty
much my day today.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.014
That has been pretty much all
I got done, still pretty good.

00:07:16.014 --> 00:07:17.930
I mean, I could show you
in Lighthouse-- we'll

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.350
save that for another time.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.099
I've already taken up
enough of your time.

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:22.770
I'm going to-- eh?

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.110
Now, you can subscribe and
you'll get more of these.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.830
And obviously, it's going
to get more exciting

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.830
as we get into the zone.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.340
But I've got good
start, got good caching,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.200
have a service worker,
got a manifest.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.090
And I've got a
Travis file in there

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.440
to do all the buildy type
stuff with Lighthouse.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.190
So we're off to a good start.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.540
Day one, winning.
