PAUL LEWIS: So it's an
interesting one, this,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.780
because I've had a
good day and a bad day.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.490
I think that's normal, isn't it?

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.100
You have some little
victories, and then you

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.480
spend a lot of your time
wrestling with something.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.800
But yeah, one of the things
I've been trying to do

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.730
is get-- I mentioned
it in the last entry

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.945
that I wanted to get Lighthouse
running because I want

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:26.070
to be able to check that
I've got a progressive web

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.860
app and everything's in place.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.120
And I know that it works.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.870
But the problem was I
wanted to push to Travis.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.740
And every time I pushed
to Travis to do the thing.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.170
But it turns out
debugging Travis locally,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.235
because you want to test it
locally, it's pretty tricky.

00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:47.932
And there is a thing you can
get, like a Docker image.

00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:49.390
But I just couldn't
get it to work.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.240
It kept timing out.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.320
I did a bit of research.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.070
And it seems that there's
some built-in thing, some kind

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.210
of timeout, within Docker.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.960
And it couldn't get
the image fast enough.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.330
And so it was just failing.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.800
And so I ended up having to
kind of step-by-step on my mark

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.950
repeat the steps.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.057
And eventually, I
kind of got there.

00:01:15.057 --> 00:01:16.140
Let me just switch across.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.220
And you can actually see.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.100
Basically, most of it was
actually OK, as it turns out.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.850
Most of this actually came
from the Lighthouse Travis

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.640
YAML, which I just updated.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.480
The thing is, it's
this little bit here

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.854
where it actually downloads
a version of Chrome

00:01:30.854 --> 00:01:32.270
because what you
want to do is you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.570
run Chrome against a
virtual display, which

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.850
is what these two lines do.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.610
But the download Chrome
script, in order to get at it,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.437
you have to NPM explore
with the Global Switch

00:01:46.437 --> 00:01:47.770
and go to the Lighthouse module.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.550
And then within there,
you can basically

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.990
tell that to download Chrome.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.720
And the thing is, it looks for
this Lighthouse Chromium path

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.494
variable, which it
then seems to ignore.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.160
It's strange because
the download Chrome

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.060
script will fail if
the Lighthouse Chromium

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.870
path isn't set.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.340
But the Lighthouse
Chromium path is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.020
set to our path prior to here.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.090
So I enter this line where
I move from slash Lighthouse

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.670
[? Chrome ?] Linux, which
is where it puts it,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.920
to the current folder.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.930
And then I can actually
run it and just check

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.214
its version or something.

00:02:21.214 --> 00:02:22.880
And then after that,
it started working.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.710
So that was a bit of a fight
that I didn't expect to have.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.150
And it wasn't-- I found that
there's just no easy way

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.532
to debug my Travis
scripts because as I said,

00:02:30.532 --> 00:02:32.490
I couldn't get this Docker
image stuff to work.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.819
So it was a bit messy.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.360
And I spent a bit
of time doing that.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.660
But on the upside, I
wanted to quickly show you

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.930
around the design.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.710
So good news is,
because I'm designing

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.450
this, the designer and the
developer get on famously.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.470
The designer is, I guess,
quite understanding

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.897
of the developer's need to
change things on the way

00:02:54.897 --> 00:02:55.730
through the process.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.230
And the developer,
well, it's almost

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.680
like they've fully understand
what the designer was

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.360
trying to achieve.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.670
It is kind of nice
when you do both parts

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.720
of a project like this,
because as I say, get the push

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.770
and pull.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.782
And it doesn't matter
if I think, ah, actually

00:03:11.782 --> 00:03:12.740
I won't do it that way.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.370
I'll do it this other way.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.010
It's fine.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.920
Right?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.260
Anyway, so the mocks.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.260
I've got some mocks.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.426
So I did this in wireframes.

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:23.240
And I did some mocks and all
sorts of stuff like that.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.350
Let me show you the home page.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.530
I'll pop that onto Chrome there.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.970
So this is what it looks like.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.680
Now, actually, if we
do chrome dev summit.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.680
I built this.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.250
And I wanted to
take this idea on.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.870
I liked this slightly angular
looking patterns and shapes.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.720
But I felt unbalanced when I
looked back at this that it

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.290
was-- the colors, I took the
colors from the Chrome logo

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.740
a little bit too literally.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.260
And so I felt like,
you know what?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.400
Actually, I'm going to
subdue it a little bit,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.400
make it a little
bit more contrasty.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.480
And I've done this.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.580
I'm told by one of my
colleagues that this

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.050
is called a hypergradient.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.566
I don't know.

00:04:18.566 --> 00:04:20.214
Basically, all it
is is I desaturate

00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:21.630
the image, boom,
put the contrast,

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.710
and then pop a gradient over the
top with a hard light transfer

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.480
mode.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.800
And you get this kind of look.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.980
Now, I could probably build
this with CSS blend modes.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.770
But they're not well
enough supported.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.360
So I am almost certainly going
to do these as actual images

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.210
like this.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.660
Anyway, so that's the home page.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.274
It's fairly simple with
a link to the code LOBs,

00:04:42.274 --> 00:04:43.690
a link to the
schedule, and a link

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.040
to the location, which is the
SFJAZZ Center in San Francisco.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.520
Bottom, privacy terms and
the code of conduct as well.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.700
So that's fine.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.440
It gets a little bit more
interesting over, I think,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.400
in the schedule.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.110
Similar kind of header,
masthead header.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.200
And then down here, I've
got the session information.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.180
And to be super clear,
the session information

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.040
is placeholder, hence, the
lorem ipsum text there.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.610
This is actually the
content from two years ago.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.700
I just copy-pasted the content
and the times and everything

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.370
else.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.120
So this isn't me
telling you what's

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.329
going to be at the Chrome Dev
Summit because I have no idea.

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:29.370
But I wanted something
that was a little bit more

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.864
realistic rather than total
lorem ipsum everywhere.

00:05:32.864 --> 00:05:33.780
Same kind of masthead.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.135
And what I'm doing
is I'm going to do

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:38.679
a static build from section
to section to section.

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:40.470
And then I'm going to
progressively enhance

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.580
to something that uses
JavaScript to swap out

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.500
these sections.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.700
And I'm still debating in my own
mind how I'm going to do that.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:56.250
I feel like maybe I'm
going to do something

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.050
where things shift up and down,
as in the image fades out.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.860
And there's this yellow
strip at the back here.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.620
I'm thinking that
might move up and down

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.720
because when you look at,
for example, the live page,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.240
you can see.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.270
There's the video player here
with the session going on.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.610
And then this is that
little yellow strip.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.640
But it's slid down and made
way for what's live now,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.980
which is apparently Jake
arguing over minutia.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.540
He does that so well.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.975
And up next is Alex Russell.

00:06:29.975 --> 00:06:30.850
And you can see them.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.300
We've got them coming up later.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.570
This is what I'm hoping
for that live section

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.090
when the conference
is actually live

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.790
that we give you what you
need, which is give me

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.270
the actual content, and
give me what's live,

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.020
what's coming up next,
and then what's in line

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.020
for the rest of the day.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.390
I don't know if I'm going to
get to doing notifications.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.240
I've put it there in
case I want to do them

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.580
and I get a chance to do them.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.830
But time may be against me.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:03.417
Right, that's probably
enough for right now.

00:07:03.417 --> 00:07:04.000
It's exciting.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.750
It's good.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.672
I have done a little
bit of coding today.

00:07:06.672 --> 00:07:08.130
But I'm going to
save that probably

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.590
for the next entry
where I can talk

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:11.934
about it in a bit more detail.

00:07:11.934 --> 00:07:12.600
So don't forget.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.000
You can subscribe.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.680
And thanks for coming
along on the journey.
