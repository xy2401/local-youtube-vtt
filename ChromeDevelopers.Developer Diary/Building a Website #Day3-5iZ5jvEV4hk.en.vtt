PAUL LEWIS: OK,
good stuff-- I've

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.720
managed to do a bit of
coding as well today,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.230
which is always handy.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.035
Because towards the
back end of this week,

00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:10.900
I'm actually speaking
at a conference.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.100
So I kind of got to get a move
on and get some stuff done.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.460
So mostly what
I've been doing is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.710
kind of setting up a little
bit more infrastructure,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.860
just making sure that kind
of everything's all set

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.990
and I've got, hopefully,
a really solid foundation

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.970
that I don't need to change
too much on the way through.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.594
Mainly what I did is, I don't
know if I mentioned it before,

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:33.510
but basically, what I
had was I was serving up

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.680
the static files.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.280
And I did all the hashing
stuff, which was cool.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.650
But everything else,
the kind of non-static,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.607
was always going to
the same index.html.

00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:45.190
So what I've done is I've just
updated that little bit of code

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.950
now where I match against
everything that kind of came

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.590
after devsummit.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.950
And then I'm looking for
that particular thing

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.420
in the sections.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.620
So like, for example,
location.html-- so

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.750
if you go to
devsummit/location, you're

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.350
going to get location.html,
which extends the base

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.780
HTML in the template
here, which basically

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.960
has the header of a block for
the content, which is actually

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.800
then filled out by that, by
the actual section, and then

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.200
the footer.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.240
All fine-- that's working
just as I'd hoped.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.090
So that's one thing that's
definitely changed in here.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.750
Other than that-- oh
yeah, a lot of changes

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.810
in the-- in the buildfile,
we've got a lot of scripts.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.410
I wanted to avoid this time
doing a full-on, gulp grunt,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.690
whatever build system.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.160
I thought, most of
the time, I'm actually

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.185
not doing anything
overly exciting.

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:47.560
I want to use SAS,
because I know

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.550
I'll want to probably make all
my sizes based off a baseline.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.970
So it's an eight-pixel
baseline grid.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.600
And then off the top of
that, I figure, well,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.370
if I've got a few variables
or whatever, SAS is probably

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.460
going to the right thing.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.720
But I'm still going to
keep it fairly minimal.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.070
Here, though, I've got an
inline CSS and a linked CSS.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.920
And this is something
I'm trying out.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.229
This may not work.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.150
And it may work.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.000
And I really don't know, so
blah, bear with me, I suppose.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.500
Right.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.570
What I'm doing-- I'll see if
I can explain this quickly.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.920
Let's see-- so I have notionally
inline CSS and linked CSS.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.420
So in the page, for
example, there's

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.330
going to be-- it
is in the header.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.460
There is the inline
styles, right?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.930
So this is the kind of-- I want
to get a fast first render.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.270
And I want some inline styles.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.870
So what goes into
the inline styles?

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.540
Basically, it's-- you know,
I have a couple of standard

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.240
import-y, include-y things.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.040
And then I've got
specific styles

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.090
at the moment just
for the header.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.800
And my theory on
the inlining styles

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.550
is that I want basically things
like dimensions and color,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.490
and that's it.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.092
As in if it's like a white
block or a green block,

00:03:03.092 --> 00:03:04.550
that's the thing
I want to reserve.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.770
That's all I care about.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.170
And pretty much everything
else will probably

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.460
be, like, sort of font
colors or whatever,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.072
but no kind of background
images or any of that.

00:03:14.072 --> 00:03:15.030
That can come in later.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.200
This is like reserving
the space for content.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.700
And I know the
height of the header.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.450
I know the height
of the masthead.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.200
I should be able to
do all of that stuff

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.520
without actually
doing anything else.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.180
In the background, once--
so all the inlining stuff

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.890
is in one place.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.610
And I'm separating out my header
into a full and an inline.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.667
And the inline is just basically
like-- you see the baseline,

00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:40.000
with a background, a box shadow.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.470
These are just
sort of placeholder

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.970
while I was just
testing the theory.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.870
And then the full one is
like-- it takes the inline,

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.250
but then it adds the stuff on.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.870
And I've been in two minds
as to whether I duplicate

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.800
the inline stuff here.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.850
Because that CSS
is going to exist.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.880
But I have a feeling
that later on, it's

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.040
going to be useful
to have something

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.430
with the full styles in it.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.080
And I can't quite put my
finger on why just yet.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.450
I think it might be to do with
the hot swapping of sections.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.280
So anyway, so I've
got the inline styles.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:21.300
And then in the-- let's
see- in the scripts-- yeah.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.820
I've got this,
where I load styles.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.320
And basically, I
load the styles.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.530
And you can see it's the
same kind of hashing system

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.775
that I used previously
for this JavaScript.

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:32.900
That's still going to work.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.025
This is going through the
templates in your system.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:38.500
It will convert this to a
[? CDS ?] dot whatever dot CSS.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.330
And in the load styles, I
basically do an [? XHR ?].

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.830
And then when I load it, I
know it's in the HTTP cache.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.910
And it should have
the-- whatever

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.720
I gave it-- like a one-year
caching time on it.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.790
Then I can inject an actual
style sheet into the head

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.529
with that URL.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.070
It'll make the request, which
will be satisfied from the HTTP

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.770
cache.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.400
And we should be good to go.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.540
So that is what happens.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.400
So just to show you, the
inline stuff for the header

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.090
doesn't have, say, a color.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.470
But the full one has
rebeccapurple as the thing.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.850
Actually, I'll tell you what.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.170
I'll change it to
red, which won't work,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.140
because I don't have it
built. So I can actually

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.300
do npn run build.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.690
I could do a watch.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.640
That would actually--
oh, it failed.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.510
Of course it failed.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.060
Well done, me.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.950
Terrific.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.350
Yeah, it's because
I didn't-- OK.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.840
Oh, git commit-- "Changes."

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.680
Just as well, this isn't
the-- oh yeah, that's fine.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.290
OK.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.200
Just as well, I
didn't actually-- see,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.180
I might change that.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.560
Because that was annoying.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.160
Right.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.701
There you go.

00:05:56.701 --> 00:05:59.010
You see, it goes red now anyway.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.810
And then the
version's been bumped.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.870
And so by default, we
have the-- la la la--

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.345
no, I don't want that.

00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:14.830
I have the inline styles like
so, which has been squished,

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.800
and compressed, and
everything else.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.940
And then there's the
link rel="stylesheet,"

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.220
which actually has
all the other stuff.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.230
And so that you can see
that the actual color is

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.680
set to red that you inherited
from, but it's still there.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.480
So there you go.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.880
That's kind of what I'm
currently doing, giving that

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.930
a whirl, seeing how that goes.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.090
The next step is to actually
start for real styling

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.950
based on the mocks and
actually start fleshing it out,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.670
which I will be building--
while I design desktop first,

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.560
I actually build mobile first.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.279
And I have in my head
the mocks or roughly

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.070
what's going to happen,
but I am definitely

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.560
going to be winging some
of it as I figure out

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.040
exactly how this should all go.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.870
So there you go.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.940
Good days, bad
days-- every day's

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.690
interesting when
you're building in it.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.190
So there you go.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.420
Thanks for coming along
on the journey as always.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.760
And don't forget your subscribe.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.907
They make me say it.

00:07:17.907 --> 00:07:18.990
They don't make me say it.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.020
I want you to
subscribe, because I

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.870
know there's loads of
really interesting stuff

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:22.494
on the channel.

00:07:22.494 --> 00:07:24.039
So yeah.

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:25.580
