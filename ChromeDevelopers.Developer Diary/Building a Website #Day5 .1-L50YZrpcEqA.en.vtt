PAUL LEWIS: I'm such an idiot.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.340
I know that errors
are going to happen.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.970
And so help me, I
should write code

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.020
that says when an error
happens, what actually happened.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.560
But I was-- I didn't.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.859
In my Python, I had
this template not found.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.400
And now you can see
here in the code,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.316
it actually says, template not
found, and then the template

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:28.899
I was looking for,
and then which file

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.370
is actually requested by.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.350
If you look at the code before
this, it said, not found.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.060
That was it.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.040
That's all it said.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.830
And what I found was
that the build script,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.950
the Travis build
script, was not working.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.590
It was failing.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.610
And I was like,
(STUTTERING) but why?

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.930
So in a previous
video, I mentioned

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.650
I couldn't get the
Travis stuff working.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.180
The Travis image wasn't working.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.370
And a bit of a Google around
and somebody else [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.300
said, you just want to restart
your default Docker machine.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.790
So it's like, docker dash
machine stop default and then

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.200
docker dash machine start
default. And what that does

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.390
is it restarts the default
Docker machine, which

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.190
is kind of what you'd expect,
given the name of the command.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.250
And after that, I
could download Travis.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.210
So I downloaded
the Travis image,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.020
which was about a gig and a
half, I think, in the end.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.450
It was pretty
sizable, this thing,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.690
so that took a while to do.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.110
So I'm sitting there
kind of like, mm-hmm.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.190
Got the file, go to
Travis image, boot it up,

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.795
and I went in and I run each
command, command, command.

00:01:40.795 --> 00:01:42.170
Because this is
what I was saying

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.162
on on the log for the Travis.

00:01:45.162 --> 00:01:46.870
It goes, blah, blah,
blah, doing a thing.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.430
And then it just says, well,
it was saying, not found.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.860
Now, this is the
interim version,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.068
which was still not building.

00:01:52.068 --> 00:01:54.500
It says, template not
found sections home.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.660
And I was like, what?

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.610
Why?

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.560
Why?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.090
What?

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.610
So anyway, I get it running,
duplicate all the steps

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.050
that this is going through
on that Travis image.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.920
And it turns out that because
it's a fresh clone, even

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.800
after the MPM installed, I
haven't actually run a build.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.860
So I don't actually bake out
the styles and the JavaScript

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.530
as part of the Travis script.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.140
And so now you can
see in the Travis YAML

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.730
the last thing it does is an
MPM run build to actually make

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.620
the JavaScript and CSS work.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.100
And I've learned
something-- re-learned

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.900
an old lesson, which
is if you actually

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.110
output what the actual
problem is, then

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.740
you will actually discover what
the probable solution will be.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.750
Rather than just
writing not found,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.250
I actually have slightly more
meaningful messages here.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.520
Probably won't be the
last time it bites me.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.700
But it did, and it took me
probably a good couple of hours

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.250
last night to try and get to
the bottom of why it was--

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.990
an embarrassingly long time.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.300
But that's what happens.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.950
So there you go, yeah.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.280
Subscribe to the channel
if you want more of these.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.370
Thank you so many--
thank you so many?

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.350
No, try that again, Paul.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.160
Thank you for all the
comments and all the questions

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.830
and all that kind of stuff.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.420
You can get the code on GitHub,
and you should definitely

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.290
go and take a look.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.170
You can see what I'm doing.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.550
I'm just committing
stuff in as I go.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.154
And it's really fun to
share all this with you.

00:03:28.154 --> 00:03:29.320
So thank you for joining me.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.153
As I say, subscribe if
you want to get more.

00:03:31.153 --> 00:03:33.950
And I'll catch you
in the next entry.
