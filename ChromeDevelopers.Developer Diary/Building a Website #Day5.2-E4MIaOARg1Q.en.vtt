PAUL LEWIS: Right, we've
got some visual progress.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.580
Finally, we've got
something on the screen that

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.540
is actually a thing to look at.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.370
And actually, even
this little header

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.270
here has presented some
interesting side challenges,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.540
mostly around what
to do with mobile.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.729
Let me show you what it
does as the screen gets

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:26.520
bigger and smaller.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.239
There we go.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:27.780
There we are.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.500
Oop.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.480
And so this small sort
of 320-ish pixel-wide,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.830
which is what you'd
find on an iPhone,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.410
it looks like that
at the moment.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.830
It has the little, you know,
the little menu thing going on.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.562
And then as the
space kind of grows,

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:46.645
you get the actual sections
and you can, you know,

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:48.010
click around and
all the rest of it.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.801
And they're little.

00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:51.530
The thing is, this
little side nav here,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.980
when you click on it--
pop-- pops out like that.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.890
But that's all done
without JavaScript.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.170
And you can toggle it
like that and so on.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.380
So the way that I've done
that is a little-- so I'm

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.340
not the first person to do this.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.060
In fact, if you
Google it, there are

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.170
plenty of people who
do similar things.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.130
What we've got here is
a label, and the label

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.590
is connected to a checkbox.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.190
And so when you
click on the label,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.370
it basically toggles
the checkbox state

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.960
from checked to not checked.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.060
And then the menu is styled
that-- you can see here--

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.990
if the checkbox is checked, and
I'm using the general sibling

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.650
selector, tell the nav to
be display block and all

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.150
the rest of it.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.750
And so you can basically--
by toggling the checkbox,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.000
you're actually toggling
the visibility of the menu.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.940
No JavaScript.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.710
And now what I'm
going to do is when

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.040
I get to adding in the
JavaScript to the site,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.415
I'm going to progressively
enhance that to something that

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:56.880
slides in and out is my plan,
because while that works,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.277
it's not the nicest
for it to just appear.

00:01:59.277 --> 00:02:00.610
I'd like it to slide in and out.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.970
But this is actually--
it's working just fine.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.229
The thing that you'll notice
when you look at blog posts

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.910
or stack [? overflowances ?]
that mention doing something

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.100
like this is that they will set
the checkbox to display non.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.820
And I didn't want
to set the checkbox

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.180
to display non because it--
so I can click on this.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.770
If you look, I can click on it.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.460
But I wanted to maintain
keyboard control,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.370
and I need to put
in focus state.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.540
Actually that's--
when I see this video,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.210
if I haven't done it already, I
want to add a focus state back

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.492
on to that so that it's very
clear that it has focus,

00:02:42.492 --> 00:02:43.700
because I think we want that.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.079
But the reason I
didn't want to set--

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.870
you can see the checkbox
there-- the reason

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.150
I didn't want to set the display
non on the checkbox itself

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.760
is because you lose the ability
to do the keyboard control.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.550
So right now, if
I hit-- if I say--

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.570
if it's got focus, by clicking
on the label, I give it focus.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.040
And I can still tap to it.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.820
If I set this-- look, if
I set this to display non,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.330
I can still click on it, but
I can't hit spacebar anymore.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.380
No amount of spacebar is
going to make that go away.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.490
Somebody who's got a desire
to use their keyboard

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.200
is going to get
frustrated with that.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.300
So I figure there's
no harm to having it

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.870
display, but opacity 0.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.510
It seems to give me the best
combination of those two.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.700
And because the
label isn't tab-able,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.340
I'm hoping that that's the
correct combination of things.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.034
I need to check with
[? Alice Box ?] or Rob Dodson

00:03:45.034 --> 00:03:46.950
to just help me make
sure that I've definitely

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.616
done that right.

00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:50.300
But anyway, that's the side nav.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.340
And it obviously
disappears and so on.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.130
So that's just a lot of sort
of CSS media breakpoint-y type

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.670
stuff.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.090
And there is this slight
curve on the header,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.345
or the slight angle,
which is done with an SVG.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.680
And let me show you
that since we're here

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.740
looking at this header.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.220
Yep, it looks like that.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.800
And it basically,
like that, sort

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.709
of scales across based on that.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.977
So because it's got
preserved aspect ratio non,

00:04:21.977 --> 00:04:24.060
and it's just width, 100%;
height, 100%, basically

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.988
whatever div I give it to,
it's going to stretch to fill--

00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:28.984
[CLEARING THROAT]

00:04:28.984 --> 00:04:29.980
Ah-hem.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.600
Oh, mh, hm, ah.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.460
Get your voice right, Paul.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.700
OK.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.470
It's going to stretch
to fill up that element.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.830
So that works out
just fine, actually.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.480
That's giving me the kind of
look that I want it to have.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.410
So there we are, a CSS only side
nav, which is doing just fine.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.920
We can click around in the
location, schedule, and so on.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.670
So making a little
bit of progress there,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.850
and a couple of interesting
little things along the way.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.957
Grand.
