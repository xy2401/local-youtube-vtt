PAUL LEWIS: A couple of minor
updates today-- firstly,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.220
that you can see on screen,
styling is getting underway,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.170
which means I've got
just a place holder

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.440
for the actual page content.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.080
But I've got a footer
in place with a couple

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.020
of links, the header.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.450
You can go around the
individual sections.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.040
Let me just make
that a bit wider.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.200
Code of conduct as
well, that's in there.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.033
Need to do a little bit
of tidying up there,

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:24.840
I think, on the
text positioning.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.840
But you can see styling
is under way, finally

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.475
getting somewhere a
little bit more visual,

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:30.350
which is good for me.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.470
And then I've also worked
down here, like so,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.320
pretty much as we
were hoping to see.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.780
So that's the good news.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.240
Oh, I should mention the other
thing, which is the styling,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.460
I've actually opted for a
slightly different solution

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.690
in the end.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.315
Do you remember how
I mentioned about I

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:53.860
was going to do inline styles
and then like full fat styles,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.510
and I wasn't sure if
it was going to work.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.910
OK, I've concluded
a couple things.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.080
Firstly, that I should
keep things simple.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.770
So let me show you what it's
like on a normal, standard

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.629
issue page.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.810
Basically, you can see here-- I
can get rid of a bunch of that

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.950
there, can't I?

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.049
We have just the style sheet,
straight in to the style sheet.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.840
So that is actually
what we're going to do.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.850
And that would be
render blocking.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.090
However, what I'm
banking on mostly

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.450
is that most people will come
via the home page to the site.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.090
So if somebody comes
here, yeah they're

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.714
going to have a bit
of render blocking.

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:31.530
I don't think it's going
to be that much, though.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.800
At the moment, the styles are 6
and 1/2 K. It's not a big deal.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.790
They'll get more.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.040
They'll get bigger, obviously.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.890
But hopefully, by the time
gzip is on, hopefully,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.480
not a huge deal.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.450
It's not loads and loads
and loads of styles,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.672
but we can still improve it.

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:51.130
And as I say, most
people, I think,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.838
are going to come to
the home page, where

00:01:52.838 --> 00:01:54.720
I take a slightly
different tack,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.570
and I do use the inline style.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.020
So I have a style tag here
with just those inline styles.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.420
So it's things like
position information

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.979
and so on-- all fine-- and a
bit of coloring information.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.250
And then I load,
via the JavaScript

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.090
that you saw last time, I inject
this style sheet by JavaScript.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.340
Some people on YouTube
were saying, well,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.400
what happens if you
don't have JavaScript?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.014
Fair enough.

00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:22.930
It's a great question.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.870
That's why no
script was invented.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.759
And inside the no script,
we can pop in the link

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.550
to the style sheet.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.970
So we'll get inline styles.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.640
If somebody hasn't
got JavaScript,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.410
then they'll get
the link injected

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.890
by the no script injected.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.860
It's in the no script.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.150
That will cause the
style sheets to download.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.750
And then for everybody
else-- and in both cases,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.790
by the way, if they
get it from here

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.450
or they get it from
the injected one, now

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.970
the cache is kind of primed.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.270
So when you then go to schedule
or location or code of conduct

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.180
or whatever, the CSS is
already in the cache,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.310
and so we'll get s
back nice and quickly.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.590
There are some file
inline styles specific

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.289
for each individual page.

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:08.330
So rather making a separate
style sheet for, say,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.620
home or schedule or
location, if there's

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.120
specific styles for that page,
I'm inlining those as well.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.304
So it's a kind of combo of
those different approaches.

00:03:19.304 --> 00:03:20.470
We'll see how that pans out.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.669
It could be that I
revisit it again.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.210
Just to show you,
though, by the way,

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.210
if I disable JavaScript in
Dev Tools, hopefully all

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.360
being well, we still
get all the styles.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.670
Because even though we
got the style there,

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.310
with the no script, you can
see that that's actually now,

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.050
instead of a piece of text,
that it's actually a link.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.370
That's actually become a thing.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.006
And you can see
here in the network,

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.380
that while we don't have any
JavaScript being downloaded,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.950
we do have the style
sheet coming in as well.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.850
So it seems like a pretty
good combination of those two,

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.500
inlines versus actual links.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.970
Good sign is that it's
not render blocking

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.140
pretty much when I do this.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.500
So hopefully, that will pan out,
but we'll see how we get on.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.080
So there you go.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.895
Some stars in place-- good.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.326
So, yeah, the mashing up of
all those styles, it's good.

00:04:16.326 --> 00:04:17.950
Don't forget you
subscribe, by the way.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.730
"You subscribe?

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.230
No.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.790
Say that again, Paul.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.070
Don't forget that
you can subscribe.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.570
I mean you should
subscribe, if you want to.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.325
Far be it for me to
tell you what you.

00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:31.250
Anyway, you can subscribe,
and hopefully you're

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.110
enjoying these diary videos.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.040
Thank you to everybody who's
been popping comments in below

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.482
and making suggestions and
just generally being involved.

00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:43.690
That's kind of what I was
hoping was going to happen.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.490
So, yeah, cool.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.600
I'll see you next time.
