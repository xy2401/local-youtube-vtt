PAUL LEWIS: Well,
it's a good day today

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.970
because I think there are a few
minor issues notwithstanding,

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.750
but actually the
majority of the site

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.360
is now built, at least from
a static point of view.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.550
So I thought what I'd do
is just show you around

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.320
very briefly so you can see
what's going on, really.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.000
So the home page, I think
this was pretty much done last

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.900
I showed you.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.180
But the location
wasn't, and that now

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.830
is, has all the
information in there.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.160
That's good.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.420
Code of conduct,
that was also done,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.430
but the schedule was not done.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.680
And within that
you've got-- and let

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.922
me show you that when you
scale it down, basically

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:49.480
I lose the images.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.970
That was sort of less important.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.070
So one of the--
there's the images,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.190
the images of the speakers

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.075
That leaves me here.

00:00:58.075 --> 00:00:59.700
Actually one of the
things I need to do

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.710
is just do a kind of
rollover state for these

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.190
so you know which one you're
actually going to click into.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.171
So I have built
sort of two states

00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:11.420
I think is the way to call it.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.445
So there's the
pretalk where we just

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:18.130
are going to give you some
information about the session.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.800
And again, there's
a little more to it.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.750
Like for example, there's
no Back button in there.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.820
And I need to decide
what I'm going

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.360
to do with the masthead area.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.100
I might just have the
picture of the speaker

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.590
or something like that, or I
might move the title in there.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.681
It really depends
on how I'm feeling,

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:36.430
and actually what the
titles are because I

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.846
have no idea what the sessions
are going to be called yet.

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:40.870
So I've tried to be
fairly agnostic about it.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.730
However, after the
talk has gone live,

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.550
then we need to be
able to embed the talk.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.030
So we've kind of got this, which
is kind of borrowed, I suppose,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.400
from the live page, which
I'll show you in a moment.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.343
So you've got
basically the video.

00:01:57.343 --> 00:02:02.040
There will be the picture of
the speaker, the title, the name

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.150
and job title, and then
a bit of a description

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.170
about what the actual talk is.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.800
So that's all fine and dandy.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.590
Basically we are pretty
much ready to go.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.490
If I show you this-- so
I have this is_live flag

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.660
in the Python.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.070
And I will probably, on
the day itself or the days

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.800
themselves, I will switch
this flag from false to true.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.590
And I might even make
it date specific.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.120
I might not.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.860
I'm not quite sure exactly how
I'm going to do it just yet.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.130
But anyway, I'll set
it to true right now.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.630
And that basically adds
this extra banner to the top

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.640
of the pages which
don't have a video,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.470
because if they've
already got a video,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.050
then I don't really want to--
like if you go into the live

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.370
stream page, then we don't--

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.480
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.077
-Today I've had
a little bit of--

00:02:51.077 --> 00:02:51.660
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.150
PAUL LEWIS: It's me,
on screen, talking

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.650
about building this site.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.710
So, hang on, that's
me on this site

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.080
looking at a video of me
talking about this site-- whoa,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.150
so meta, wonderfully meta.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.720
Good.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.940
So, what was I saying?

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.090
What was I saying?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.686
Oh yeah, if you've
got a video playing,

00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:18.560
we don't want to have
that watch live stream,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.560
because you're already
watching the live stream.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.430
So that's just kind
of a minor thing.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.530
And it's got this
little Live now,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.130
Up Next, and then things
that are coming up

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.810
the rest of the day.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.960
So my next step
with all this, now

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.680
that this is all
fully working, is

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.010
to make it kind of
a little bit more

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.330
exciting and dynamic I suppose,
because we've got a solid base.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.515
You could deploy this
site, and there would

00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:48.830
be nothing wrong with that.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.670
This is a perfectly
functioning site.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.250
So anything I add on now, which
would be to do a proper service

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.040
worker, to-- I'm
going to try and do

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.180
some transitions between
sections and kind

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.110
of dynamically load in content
rather than like a full page

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.890
refresh.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.840
I'm hoping to kind of
fade content in and out

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.950
and move things around.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.030
All that kind of stuff is a
progressive enhancement move

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.670
by me.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.670
So I don't have to do any of it,
but it's worth doing, I think.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.000
OK, so there isn't much
code to show you today.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.570
I just wanted to
kind of check in

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.450
to show you that
we've got to a point

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.330
now where we could
deploy this site.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.512
We could call this one done.

00:04:29.512 --> 00:04:31.095
But we're going to
take it further on.

00:04:31.095 --> 00:04:34.790
I'm going to try and make
some more exciting maneuvers

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.020
in there, and we'll see
how it all pans out.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.310
Thank you so much for coming
along on this journey with me.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.000
I am loving every minute
of sharing all this stuff

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.500
with you.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.500
Thank you to everybody who's
commenting, who's subscribing,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.030
and checking out the
code on GitHub as well.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.770
Let's make it
progressively enhanced

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.390
and betterer and awesomer, yes.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.740
