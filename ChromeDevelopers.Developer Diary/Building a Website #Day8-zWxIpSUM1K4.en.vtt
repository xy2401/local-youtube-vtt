00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.300
PAUL LEWIS: So with
the site mostly done

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.350
from a visual point
of view, I wanted

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.140
to go back and take a
look at accessibility.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.190
Now I'm not an
accessibility expert.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.600
I know it much less than
I understand other things,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.100
like performance
or CSS or whatever.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.140
So I wanted to kind of
show it because it's

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.210
a journey I'm kind of
going on to kind of improve

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.630
my understanding in this area.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.520
And so I at least want to show
you the changes that I made,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.430
or at least kind of how I
checked some of the changes

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.810
that I made on the site.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.610
So on screen, I have-- I'm
going to enable a VoiceOver.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.390
VOICEOVER: Welcome to
OS X. VoiceOver is on.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.530
System Preferences,
Accessibility window,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.750
Help button.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.160
PAUL LEWIS: OK,
it's definitely on,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.930
because it's
talking at me, which

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.250
is kind of what you're hoping--

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.041
VOICEOVER: You are
currently on the button.

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.630
To click this button,
press Control-Option-Space.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.960
PAUL LEWIS: OK, I don't
want to do anything.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.660
Don't talk.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.720
I'm talking.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.520
I'm talking.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.950
You don't talk.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.880
Stop it.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.800
OK, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to dive into the page.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.240
And then this is before
I made my changes.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.010
OK, all right.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.415
VOICEOVER: Chrome, Chrome Dev
Summit 2-0-1-6 window, footer,

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:20.570
vi-- vi-- visited link.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.590
Chrome Dev Summit.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.592
PAUL LEWIS: OK,
it'll talk again.

00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:26.800
It has a thing about talking.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.630
VOICEOVER: You are currently
on a link inside of a banner.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.980
To click this link, press
Control-Option-Space.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.810
The help tag is Go to Home page.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.730
PAUL LEWIS: OK, Go to Home
page, seems like a good thing.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.270
OK, so to keep this
video brief, I'm

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.410
just going to kind of show
only a couple of changes

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.700
that I've made.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.750
But you can
extrapolate that I've

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.180
made changes to
all the templates

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.920
around the site off the back
of this, all being well.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.354
Let me see if I got this right.

00:01:56.354 --> 00:01:57.770
VOICEOVER: Navigation,
four items.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.478
PAUL LEWIS: Oh no,
this is the old build.

00:01:59.478 --> 00:02:01.760
Oh dear, let's have a look.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.350
VOICEOVER: System--
term-- npm run build.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.880
Chrome-- Chrome Dev Summit
2-0-1-- banner three items,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.460
visited link, Chrome Dev
Summit, list four items.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.960
Schedule--

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.690
PAUL LEWIS: OK,
this is the old one.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.190
Right--

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.398
VOICEOVER: Chrome Dev Summit.

00:02:19.398 --> 00:02:21.680
PAUL LEWIS: Yep.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.960
I know you're going to talk.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.060
I'm going to go
across to the list.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.750
VOICEOVER: List four items.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.360
PAUL LEWIS: Now it's not a list.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.990
This is the thing,
it's actually a nav.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.610
VOICEOVER: You are currently
on a list inside of a banner.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.330
PAUL LEWIS: See, I'm not.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.940
I'm not.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.630
I'm in a navigation,
admittedly inside of a banner.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.240
I'll take that up.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.750
So that's one thing
that isn't right.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.150
And actually when we
look at the source code

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.590
in a moment-- in fact, let
me just switch off-- no,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.130
I'll show you the
other bit as well.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.650
So we can use-- it's like
Control-Left, Right arrows

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.410
to kind of skip
through elements.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.504
VOICEOVER: Visited end of list.

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:00.670
PAUL LEWIS: End of list, OK.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.870
VOICEOVER: Visited link.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.240
Watch the live stream now.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.156
PAUL LEWIS: Seem good.

00:03:04.156 --> 00:03:06.744
VOICEOVER: End of-- heading
level one, Chrome Dev Summit.

00:03:06.744 --> 00:03:07.910
PAUL LEWIS: Also seems good.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.190
VOICEOVER:
Complimentary one item.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.530
PAUL LEWIS: Not complimentary.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.810
VOICEOVER: Connect
with Chrome engineers

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.350
and other leading
developers for a two day

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.390
exploration of building
beautiful and performant

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.911
experiences.

00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:16.910
PAUL LEWIS: Sounds good.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.040
VOICEOVER: End of complimentary.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.373
PAUL LEWIS: Not a complimentary.

00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:20.820
VOICEOVER: Visited link.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.570
Schedule will take a
look over the agenda.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.220
PAUL LEWIS: Feels
like you should

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.770
be giving me a little bit of
a gap there, like a full stop.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.070
VOICEOVER: Visited link.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.970
Code lab, check out our
step by step coding guides.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.400
Visited link.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.195
Location Chrome Dev
Summit is at S-F-J-A-Z-Z.

00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:37.760
PAUL LEWIS: S-F-J-A-Z-Z-- not
really, it's at "SF Jazz."

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.470
And I understand why
a screen reader--

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.740
VOICEOVER: You are currently on
a link inside of HTML content.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.790
To click this link, press
Control-Option-Space.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.910
PAUL LEWIS: I can understand
why a screen reader

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.090
wouldn't understand
that it's SFJAZZ,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.610
that it would think it's
S-F-J-A-Z-Z, or "zed-zed"

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.650
for me because English.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.300
So what I will do is
I will temporarily

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.880
switch off VoiceOver.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.530
Let's do that.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.300
VOICEOVER: System--
system preference--

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.340
PAUL LEWIS: Quick.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.270
Oh no, no, no, no, no, stop it.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.560
OK, ooh-- ooh.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.120
So there's a small chance it can
be a little bit stressful when

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.940
it's talking at you,
especially when you're

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.140
trying to record a video
explaining-- yeah, right.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.380
Let me move the build on.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.020
I think the build
I want is that one.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.950
Yeah, it has labels
and what not.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.270
And we'll do a fresh build.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.620
So now you can see,
when I do that--

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.020
and let's see if the
code is there as well.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.670
Let's go and find.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.710
Where would be a good place?

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.860
I think the masthead
is certainly one place.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.750
You can see the
masthead graphic,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.880
which is that SVG
debacle-- let's

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.050
call it what it is, the
debacle that was-- has an ARIA

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.030
label of now masthead.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.600
And then I've added this
masthead image title.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.900
So that's going to be
something that should hopefully

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.820
be announced as well.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.800
Things like titles, that's
gone on as well in the head,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.000
maybe, or in the header.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.290
Did I bring that-- it's in
the header-- in the header.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.170
Or is it head?

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.222
Which one is it?

00:05:26.222 --> 00:05:30.490
Whoa, hang on.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.072
That's weird.

00:05:32.072 --> 00:05:33.530
Why are they saying
the same thing?

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.960
That's not the right thing.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.030
Or has it got itself confused?

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.187
It might have got
itself confused.

00:05:41.187 --> 00:05:42.520
OK, I'll tell you what we'll do.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.728
We'll just look at it in
the source code of the page.

00:05:44.728 --> 00:05:46.030
That'll do it.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.990
Instead, we now have a
nav called menu__nav.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.590
And instead of there being
a list, they're just divs.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.930
And because this is set to
display flex, this is fine.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.425
They're individual
items, each with anchor.

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.300
I probably don't even
need the divs actually.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.914
I might just remove
those and put the class

00:06:03.914 --> 00:06:04.955
straight onto the anchor.

00:06:04.955 --> 00:06:07.030
That would probably be
even tidier, less markup.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.270
I might just do
that today in fact.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.220
What an idea.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.580
And then here's another
little thing that I did,

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.630
which I just want to show.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.850
This is after a chat
with-- let me zoom in--

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.060
after a chat with Jake
Archibald, my colleague.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.190
Hopefully many of you know Jake.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.030
If you don't, he's
one of my colleagues.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.670
I said that.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.210
So now Chrome Dev Summit
is at SF, and then Jazz,

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.990
in lower case.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.750
And then this in between
it, you might be thinking,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.050
what on earth is that?

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.090
The answer is, it's
the Unicode character

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:51.730
for a nonvisible space so that
it renders as SFJAZZ together,

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.636
but it's actually
pronounced as SF Jazz.

00:06:55.636 --> 00:06:58.856
So we're kind of doing
the visual thing as well

00:06:58.856 --> 00:06:59.980
as the screen reader thing.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.510
And then I use a
CSS text transform

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.420
to bring that all
to uppercase, which

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.310
is why it's wrapped
in a span you see.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.550
That will do the trick.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:16.050
Now with that said, I can now
switch on VoiceOver once more.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.410
It's going to talk at us again.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.300
VOICEOVER: Welcome to
OS X. VoiceOver is on.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.440
System Preferences,
Accessibility window,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.282
Help button.

00:07:27.282 --> 00:07:29.740
PAUL LEWIS: OK, and we'll start
hopefully at the top again.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.430
VOICEOVER: Schedule,
select visited link.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.590

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.360
PAUL LEWIS: Navigation
four items, better.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.062
VOICEOVER: Visited link,
visited link, location.

00:07:40.062 --> 00:07:40.770
PAUL LEWIS: Fine.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.340
VOICEOVER: End of navigation.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.600

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.480
End of banner.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.370
Heading level one.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:47.850
PAUL LEWIS: And?

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.190
VOICEOVER: Masthead, Darin
Fisher delivering the keynote

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.235
at Chrome Dev Summit 2-0-1-5.

00:07:52.235 --> 00:07:52.735
Image.

00:07:52.735 --> 00:07:54.920
PAUL LEWIS: I would have
said 20-15, but whatever.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.210
VOICEOVER: Connect
with Chrome engineers

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.030
and other leading developers
for a two day expo.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:58.696
PAUL LEWIS: Yep.

00:07:58.696 --> 00:07:59.700
VOICEOVER: Visited link.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.680
Schedule.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.160
Take a look over the agenda.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
PAUL LEWIS: That's because
I used an after there

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.460
to put a full stop in.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.760
VOICEOVER: Visited link.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.800
Code labs.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.750
Check out our step by
step coding guides.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.420
PAUL LEWIS: And that after
has an opacity of zero.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.030
And--

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.190
VOICEOVER: Visited link.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.230
Location.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.220
Chrome Dev Summit
is at "SF Jazz."

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.020
PAUL LEWIS: Yes.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.920
VOICEOVER: Visual--
System Preferences.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.360
PAUL LEWIS: Right.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.420
So basically that's
what I've been doing

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.940
is I've been going through,
making sure that there's

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.780
Tab focus.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.492
And when you Tab between things
or use the focus shifting

00:08:31.492 --> 00:08:33.700
in VoiceOver-- I'm not even
sure what that's probably

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.076
called-- that it announces
the things that I expect

00:08:36.076 --> 00:08:37.659
it to announce in
the way that I would

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:38.950
expect them to be announced.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.710
So most of the time it's
a case of putting titles

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.120
on things or alternate
images, or things

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.490
like the masthead where
there isn't a-- like I'm

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.820
using multiple elements
to kind of achieve

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.020
the effect of whatever.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.050
I'm having to use ARIA
role, or just role

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.550
equals image for
example, and then

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.240
ARIA label equals, and then
what I would put in an alt text

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.720
should it have been an image.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.230
The other thing, let me just see
if I can switch it on quickly.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.980
If not, I will show
you how one does it.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.590
Yes, so it's not
switched on on here.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:19.310
So let's go to chrome://flags,
and Developer Tools

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.060
experiments.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.797
We'll enable that.

00:09:22.797 --> 00:09:23.297
Relaunch.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.340
And now inside of the
Dev Tools settings,

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.434
we have the experiments.

00:09:32.434 --> 00:09:34.100
And there's an
accessibility inspection.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.090
And it is always
worth pointing out

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.040
that these experiments
could be dangerous.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.350
But let's make that bigger.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:50.170
They could be dangerous
and may require a restart.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.930
And they could
cause other issues.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.970
So switch them on
at your own peril.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:01.150
But anyway, I'll switch on
the accessibly inspection.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.240
And then let's take
our inspect here.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.010
We'll do that.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.210
And there's now an
Accessibility tab down here.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.183
And you can see the
name, which is location,

00:10:11.183 --> 00:10:15.820
Chrome Dev Summit is at SFJAZZ,
contents, and what its role is.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.530
So you can very
quickly, if you just

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.880
want to check without
actually switching on a screen

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.390
reader or anything like that,
you can have a do with a that

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.370
and switch that on and
play around with that.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.453
And hopefully it will tell
you all the right kinds

00:10:28.453 --> 00:10:29.410
of things or labels.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.820
And let me just try
that on the masthead.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.266
Let's see, I think it's
on masthead itself maybe.

00:10:35.266 --> 00:10:37.390
Well maybe the masthead
graphic-- masthead graphic.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:37.960
There we are.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.430
Role of image, and ARIA
label of what we'd expect.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.680
And as you see, it bears out
that when I actually use,

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.040
at least VoiceOver
anyway, that I'm getting

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.190
the right kinds of things.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.189
I know I still have more
work to do in this area

00:10:50.189 --> 00:10:56.300
because the side nav, I
will need to put on inert.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.610
And if not heard
of inert, we will

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.590
link to Rob Dodson's inert
polyfill A11lycast, which

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.410
you should definitely watch,
is a very straightforward way

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:11.924
of saying, this thing is
not visible right now.

00:11:11.924 --> 00:11:13.340
And I'll probably
need that if I'm

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.127
going to do a sliding
in and out side nav.

00:11:15.127 --> 00:11:17.460
And in fact he actually talked
about a previous side nav

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.880
I'd built in that episode.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.970
And also I need to find
a way of making sure

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.999
that the tab focus is sort
of locked into the side nav

00:11:24.999 --> 00:11:27.040
when it's out, because
it's kind of like a modal.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.090
Anyway, all that and
more you will discover

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.210
if you watch A11lycasts.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:35.940
So, as always, check
out the code on GitHub.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.031
You can see hello to
me in the comments.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.280
I've been responding to a lot.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.310
If I've missed your
comment, I'm very sorry.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.690
Keep trying.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.860
You can say hello to me
on Twitter @AeroTwist.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.570
And I will, of course,
see you in the next entry.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:56.330
Yes, that's when I'll be back.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:56.890
Brilliant.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:57.556
Have a good day.

00:11:57.556 --> 00:12:00.840
