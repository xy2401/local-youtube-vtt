MAT SCALES: Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.645
My name's Mat Scales, and I'm
with Google's web developer

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:04.379
relations team.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:05.920
I'm building a web
app at the moment,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.710
and I'd like to share with
you my process for building

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.830
that app, as well as talking
about any problems that I have

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.600
and anything interesting
I learn along the way.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.780
So let's take a look
at what I'm building.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.997
So here we can see a
prototype of my camera app.

00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:21.580
On screen at the moment is the
photos that I've already taken,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.370
as well as a photo
I've imported, mostly

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.650
my face, because that's
what I have around

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.200
when I'm developing.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.860
And we have the ability here
to either upload a photo

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.970
or drag and drop it in or
use the camera on the device

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.850
to take a photo.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.310
On a mobile phone, we're going
to be adding in capabilities

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.101
to do all of the things
that your camera is

00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:47.430
capable of, like firing the
flash or changing the ISO

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.714
or changing where the focus
point is on the screen.

00:00:50.714 --> 00:00:52.380
At the moment, I've
only got the ability

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.860
to change the mirroring
for selfie mode.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.430
So let's take a photo.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.900
And now we're into edit mode.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.660
And we have a fairly
standard set of filters

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.120
here, things that you'd see
in any photo editing app.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.970
So I've got saturation.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.760
And I'm using WebGL to render
the filter effects in real time

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.551
as you move the slider.

00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:15.300
As we go on, we're
going to be adding lots

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.770
more features to the app.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.500
We're going to start by changing
the camera settings when

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.700
we actually take the photo.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.300
So on a mobile device
we'll be able to use things

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.800
like auto white balance.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.050
We'll be able to
change the focus point

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.990
or actually fire the flash.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.970
We're going to be adding in
new filters, particularly

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.760
like, named filters, or a set
of filters where you click on it

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.760
and it does a whole bunch
of things all at once.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.910
We're going to try to make that
really smooth and really fast.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.050
And we'll be adding in all
of these things for video.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.130
So we have to capture
video and then live

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.220
preview the video
with the effects added

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.899
and create the output
video there on the device.

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.440
So if that sounds
interesting to you,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.230
please join me again to
hear more about that.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.567
And thank you for watching.

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:01.400
Thanks for watching.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.566

of our videos, click here.

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:04.940
And we'll see you again.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.490
Cheers.
