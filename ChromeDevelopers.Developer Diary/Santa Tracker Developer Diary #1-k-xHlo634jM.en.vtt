SAM THOROGOOD:
Hey everyone, it's

00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:03.510
Sam here from Google's
Developer Relations Team.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.740
It's nice to see you.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.240
This is a brand new
development area

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.420
about Google's Santa Tracker,
a fun, educational website

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.750
that we release every
year in December.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.250
This site is built by a whole
team of helper elves, not just

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.060
me.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.790
So let's get started and
have a look at the site.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.500
Santa Tracker as a
winter playground.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.150
We have a bunch of different
scenes here to explore,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.733
different houses, including some
which are very coding themed,

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.710
which we really like.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.160
There are some Easter eggs
hidden throughout the site,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.118
you know, things like
this little balloon here,

00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:29.370
which you can take off.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.860
And it's mostly built with
Polymer, the web framework.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.940
In this series,
we're going to share

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.070
a bunch of learnings with you,
things that we've discovered

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.611
in building Santa
Tracker, and things

00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:38.445
you can take away and
use in your own sites.

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:39.944
The most important
thing to remember

00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:41.580
is that Santa
Tracker is on GitHub.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.410
So you can actually
follow along at home.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.180
Go to the Google organization
here, and check out

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.990
Santa Tracker web.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.690
The instructions are
below how to build it.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.717
So curl up by the fire,
grab a cup of hot cocoa,

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.800
and learn a little bit
about Santa Tracker with me

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.660
this holiday season.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.630
Thanks for watching.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.240

Google Chrome Developer channel

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.080
