SAM THOROGOOD: Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.500
It's Sam here.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.170
On this very short episode of
today's Santa Tracker Developer

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.780
Diary, I want to
talk about SVGs.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.760
These are the lovely
responsive images

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.920
that we use all over the
place in Santa Tracker.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.440
Our houses, our elves,
our cute little scenes

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.680
are all SVGs with only a
few PNGs to sort of round

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.100
out the edges.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.619
Now, a disclaimer.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.410
I'm not a designer.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.030
I didn't make these SVGs.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.520
And what I want
to tell you today

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.070
is about how I, as an engineer,
will work with these SVGs

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.590
to make them smaller and
better for your users.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.995
So let's have a look.

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:33.370
So when you think of SVGs,
this is what you might expect.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.731
You will see an SVG tag.

00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:35.980
You'll see a few other things.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.750
And this is basically XML.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.370
SVG is really two things.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.052
It's mockup and content.

00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:42.010
So this is very normal.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.710
The mockup looks
very structured.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.330
However, when we actually
ship our assets to users,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.897
we use a tool called SVGO--

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:50.230
and there's an online version,
which is in the resources

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.040
below--

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.387
to convert these files to
something that's very small.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.720
What's important to remember
is this really just shrinks

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.440
the mockup.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.510
It doesn't shrink the
content in any way.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.660
So if you have too much content,
which I'll explain in a second,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.959
your file size will go
down, but not enormously.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.080
The sort of assets we deal
with are reasonably large SVGs.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.600
Quite simply, when I try
to think about my SVGs

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.150
and how I can make them
smaller, I'll just sort by size

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.320
and maybe pick on
the biggest file.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.950
So in this case, we've got
two Easter egg trees here.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.390
And actually, the old one
is the one we had last year.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.630
And the new one, the lower one,
is the one we had this year.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.010
They look exactly the same.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.680
So why are they
different in size?

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.240
Let's have a look
at the old version.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.490
So on my Mac, I've got Sketch.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.610
But you might be
using some other tool

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.920
on a different platform.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.436
This asset looks fine.

00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:34.810
It looks the same
as the new one.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.560
And actually, it's
still reasonably small.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.280
It's about 150k, which for a
complicated asset with lots

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.750
of small detail,
does make sense.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.390
But it's worth
looking at your SVGs,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.410
especially considering that
the tools that generate these,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.770
they're computer programs, too.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.990
And they also make mistakes.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.900
So let's look at this
tree we've now opened.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.470
So it looks pretty good.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.140
It's about 150k,
which makes sense.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.640
It's a complicated
tree, and there's

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.098
a lot of fine detail on the
bottom with the different elves

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:00.140
and so on.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.600
But if we dig around
this XML file,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.060
we can actually see that
these dots at the bottom here,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.330
the totems I guess
you'd call them,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.930
are actually made
up of a lot of dots.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.241
So that's kind of weird.

00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:10.990
We noticed this last
year, and we actually

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.530
could delete most of them.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.960
And now you'll see that we have
one blue dot and one gray dot.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.840
And so rather than shoving what
was about 30 different dots,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.160
I think, times however many
totems were around the circle,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.520
we then shrunk that image by
just modifying those gray dots

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.085
manually to make them
big, to make them lines.

00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:32.710
And so that was a way we shrunk
that asset almost by half, just

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.840
by simplifying some
detail that didn't really

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.490
matter for users
looking at that tree

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.960
in the middle of their village.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.260
The next thing we often look
at is things like storyboards.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.500
And what does that mean?

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.583
So if we load up a different
asset-- in this case,

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:47.560
it's the road image that sits in
the back of our village here--

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.900
you'll see that while the
main part of the image

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.750
is to the right here, we have
this storyboard in the very

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.740
top left.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.165
Now, as an engineer,
you might think, oh,

00:02:56.165 --> 00:02:57.040
I should delete that.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.290
It'll save me space.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.957
But interestingly
enough, this is a case

00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:01.373
where actually
getting rid of them

00:03:01.373 --> 00:03:02.800
doesn't really
help you very much.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.490
So these assets up here are all
found in the village itself.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.400
And the way this SVG was
written is that this is actually

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.270
like a symbol.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.125
So it's duplicated
in two places.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.250
So if I delete this, which
is totally possible if I

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.244
go toggle clickthrough,
select, and delete,

00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:20.410
you'll find that the exported
version doesn't really

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.160
get much smaller,
because it's really just

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.470
a duplication of that asset.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.080
And that's a value that
SVG has in terms of mockup.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.730
Unlike a PNG, that
doesn't take up space.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.090
But it's something
that you can simplify,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.570
but it doesn't really help you.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.660
Another thing I want to call out
is that if I was to export this

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.550
image-- and this is
a complicated asset--

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.900
it's about 136k,
as we discovered,

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.500
it actually ends up
being about 1.5 meg.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.460
So in this case, that
makes total sense.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.050
This is a very
large asset, which

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.120
lives across the entire
site, and we use it

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.690
at multiple screen sizes.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.950
So an SVG is perfect.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.550
We really never want to
convert this to a PNG.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.340
However, if you have very fine
detail, like small assets,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.346
this is the case where
a PNG is really useful.

00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:01.970
And this is the reason we use it
in a few places like [? new ?]

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.180
[? Today ?] cards, for
instance, are all PNGs,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.660
because this has a lot of very
solid colors that is always

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.940
used at a one
consistent screen size.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.080
So one last thing.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.880
You can compress your SVGs.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.346
You can use gzip to convert your
SVGs to an SVG Z file, which

00:04:16.346 --> 00:04:17.470
kind of makes sense, right?

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.450
Your PNGs are
fundamentally compressed,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.339
so why not your SVGs?

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.010
But the reality is is that
nearly every web server

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.780
is gzipping your files anyway.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.880
And so most clients
will receive your files,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.544
whether they be
HTML, PNG, or SVGs,

00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:33.460
gzipped down, so there
are already fewer bytes

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.230
for your clients, anyway.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.177
That was SVGs done with Santa
Tracker I'll see you next time.
