SAM THOROGOOD: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.447
It's Sam here.

00:00:02.447 --> 00:00:04.780
On the last episode of the
Santa Tracker Developer Diary

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.552
for this year, I want to talk
about the tracker itself.

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:09.010
Now, this is what
you see if you go

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.380
to Santa Tracker
on the 24th or 25th

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.900
as Santa is flying around
the world delivering presents

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.910
to all the good boys and girls.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.460
Now, the tracker is made
up of a couple of things.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.990
It's made up of the map itself.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.600
It's made up of the way we
get data from the server

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.970
to show where Santa is.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.470
And we also want to reuse the
map throughout the site, which

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.530
is pretty cool.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.700
Let's have a look.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.400
So this is the tracker itself.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.236
We can see Santa fly
around the world here.

00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:33.610
We can see where
he currently is.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.792
He's in San Francisco.

00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:37.000
And you can see that he's
not delivered any presents,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.714
because this is
actually a trial run.

00:00:38.714 --> 00:00:40.880
We can see a few other
things too, like the weather,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.999
and we can also play
some games down here.

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.040
So unlike the village,
which is very interactive,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.710
we keep this simple and show
the games in a card layout.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.500
There's also a few secret games
that aren't normally visible

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.660
but I just made available
for the tracker itself,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.320
like this trivia game here.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.945
We also have a few
videos to watch down

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:58.150
at the bottom and a social feed.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.580
So we fetch Santa's
route in one of two ways

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.347
based on whether you're on the
Android client or on the web.

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:04.930
Obviously, this is
a series about web,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.320
but on Android we use the
Firebase Remote Config

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.100
API, which is
actually really nice

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.890
as it allows us to send
down a JSON blob to clients

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.580
and actually update
that fairly rapidly.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.580
That's really important
because if Santa changes

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.710
his route on the fly,
we can get a new version

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.194
almost immediately.

00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:20.860
We do something very
similar on the web.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.777
We've got an API server,
which is internal,

00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:24.360
which kind of emulates
the same thing.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.470
But in our case, we poll
that every minute or so.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.640
And so this sync method here
on the Santa server's object

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.390
actually does that work for us.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.450
So this is called
every minute or so.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.760
And it requests our info object.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.490
And so that returns things
like the current status,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.250
any upgrades that are
acquired by the client.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.930
Let's say your site
is out of date.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.969
And then it also includes
things like the route.

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.510
So we then use the
route method here,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.450
which builds on that
data we already fetched,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.044
and we fetch the data,
this route URL here.

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:54.460
As you can see, we're actually
storing it in local storage

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.440
as well.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.690
The route's quite large.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.690
When it's not gzipped,
it's about 500k.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.250
When it's gzipped,
it's much smaller.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.720
But we still want to store
that in local storage

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.180
rather than fetching
it every time

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.960
a user navigates
back to the site.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.000
And that JSON we store
in Firebase Storage,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.830
Santa uploads it there when
a new route is submitted.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.320
So how do we then
use that route?

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.450
So inside our new tracker scene,
as opposed to our old tracker

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.525
as we've got some great
naming right here,

00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:19.900
we actually call the Santa
sync method when sync happens.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.300
And so that method,
if we can find it,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.330
does a couple of things.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.570
It basically takes the data
that we have and does a few more

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.070
updates.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.903
There's a bit of a chain
here as we can see.

00:02:28.903 --> 00:02:32.740
So as a relative Santa sync,
we update Santa's state,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.120
which basically means
placing Santa on the map.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.860
So that's really nice, right?

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.151
You can see this is actually
a really simple call here.

00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:40.900
We say, this map, santaLatLng,
equals data.position, which

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.770
is Santa's current position.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.370
But actually, what's really cool
is while you always obviously

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.610
see the map here with everything
around, all the little cards

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.170
and stuff like that,
we can actually

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.795
use this as a reusable
component, which

00:02:51.795 --> 00:02:53.300
I think is really interesting.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.000
So let's look at this
tracker demo page.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.790
All this does is take a
reusable tracker map element

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.320
and places it on the page here.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.460
So of course that's
not very interesting.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.668
We don't know where Santa is.

00:03:01.668 --> 00:03:03.130
We haven't hooked
it up to the API.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.450
But I think this is really cool.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.070
Because as someone
who works on the web,

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.653
I can take this
component and reuse it

00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:09.250
in a bunch of places on my site.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.930
And in Santa
Tracker, we do that.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.540
We use the map obviously
in the tracker itself.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.950
But we also use
a cutdown version

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.960
of the map in our
Cast experience.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.280
Because Chromecast is quite
an underpowered device.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.560
We don't want to do
too much on that.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.910
So we only want to
show the map on Santa.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.534
We don't want to show
other information

00:03:23.534 --> 00:03:27.220
about the social feed or other
videos or things like that.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.140
So the way we can
use this is, so I've

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.960
created a thing called map,
which is the object here.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.310
And I can say
map.santaLatLng equals--

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.720
let's pick a location.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.450
I also need to set
map.santaHeading

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.000
equals-- let's say 120.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.320
So great, this turns out to
be the middle of the ocean.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.778
But we can see that Santa is
flying in a certain direction.

00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:50.064
We can even turn him around.

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:50.980
So this is quite cute.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.410
And we love the idea that we
can reuse this custom element

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.250
anywhere on our site.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.124
And this is something
we get through Polymer.

00:03:56.124 --> 00:03:58.240
So while this is obviously
a very simple example,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.770
this tracker map here
is very powerful.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.440
And it allows us to wrap
up a bunch of the behavior

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.560
and a bunch of the
stuff we want to do

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.277
with Santa Tracker
every year, like

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:05.860
show the markers of
where Santa's been

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.570
and show his route line.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.330
So every year, Santa visits
about 500 different cities

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.320
around the world, give or take.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.494
However, he is a bit
magical and turns out

00:04:14.494 --> 00:04:16.660
he wants to deliver presents
to everybody, no matter

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.829
where you are.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.990
What we actually do
is take your GeoIP.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.490
Now GeoIP is pretty coarse.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.232
It's only about
city level detail.

00:04:23.232 --> 00:04:24.940
But we use that to
make sure Santa visits

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.539
your house, no matter what.

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.330
So if you're up late
on the 24th this year,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.496
make sure you check out
Santa Tracker, because Santa

00:04:30.496 --> 00:04:32.230
might just be above your place.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.520
Thanks for watching this year.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.840
Have a happy holidays.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.310
And I hope Santa is good to you.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.175
See you next year.
