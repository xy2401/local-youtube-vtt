desk, and then a real engineer

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.700
stood behind you
and held your hands.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.200
Maybe--

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.340
ROB DODSON: Like the
scene from "Ghost."

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.839
No.

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.499
JAKE: Yeah, is there a special
pair of gloves that has two--

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:12.790
you put the gloves on, they put

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.200
SURMA: The tandem--

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.530
JAKE: --their hands
in the gloves.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.216
SURMA: --gloves.

00:00:14.216 --> 00:00:15.340
JAKE: --and they just type.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.298
They're like, Rob, this
counts as you doing it.

00:00:17.298 --> 00:00:17.950
This is you.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.406
Look, you're writing C++.

00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:20.500
Look at you go.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.470
Look at you go.

SURMA: I don't know how you
feel about existential crises,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.370
but who are you, and why?

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.020
ROB DODSON: So,
hi, I'm Rob Dodson.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.530
I'm a developer advocate
on the Chrome team.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.720
And why-- I mainly work on
accessibility, and trying

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.240
to sort of teach developers
how to build accessible

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.580
applications, make sure it's
part of their daily habit

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.890
when they're doing their work.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.440
SURMA: I think you're
the first one who

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.148
just glosses over the
why, and just turns

00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:55.110
into a job description.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.980
ROB DODSON: I--

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.410
SURMA: Like, we've gotten
very weird answers.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.420
JAKE: That's DevRel
training, right?

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.490
SURMA: Yeah, it's just like--

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.760
ROB DODSON: Yeah.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.200
I just reverted
back to my training,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.449
and it just sort of kicked in.

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.246
I imagined I was on a stage,
and it was going badly,

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:06.870
and I just started
saying my job title.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.590
JAKE: We just sort of activated
you there, that was it.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.524
Well, bringing you
back to humanity,

00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:13.440
so you've been doing an
eng rotation recently.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.481
ROB DODSON: I have, yeah.

00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:15.570
JAKE: So what's that?

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.030
You stand in the spot and spin
around, but with a computer.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.004
ROB DODSON: With the
other eng people.

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:21.420
SURMA: It's like
a spinning class.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.930
JAKE: Yeah.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.070
ROB DODSON: Yeah.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.330
So what I've been doing the
previous quarter was actually

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.000
working on Chromium,
so working in C++.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.520
SURMA: That's dreadful.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.235
ROB DODSON: It was, because I
didn't know C++ when I started

00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:35.735
it.

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:38.220
So I learned enough
C++ to be bad at it,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.740
and then I started shipping
code in the browser, which was--

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.330
SURMA: And having
other people review

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.520
your code until you were--

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.790
ROB DODSON: Yeah, so basically
the way that works is,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.730
like, I put up a patch, and
someone goes, it's horrible.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.189
And then I'm like--
they're like, down there;

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:50.980
move it over there.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.780
And I'm like, here?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.220
And they're like, there?

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.100
And I'm like, here?

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.300
And they're like, yes.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.700
The funny thing was it wasn't
even an engineer I knew.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.670
It was an engineer from
a different browser,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.710
who was just so
annoyed by my bad code

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.220
that they just showed up
from, like, another continent,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.290
and were like, (IN THROATY,
ANIMATED TONE) stop!

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.179
Like, do it this way.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.470
JAKE: That's a long way to run.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.009
ROB DODSON: Yes.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.680
JAKE: So another continent--

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.090
ROB DODSON: But they
brought the gloves.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.160
JAKE: They see your
code, and they stand up

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.540
and they go, (IN
SLOW MOTION) no.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.190
But from--

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.530
ROB DODSON: Something like that.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.265
JAKE: From where?

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:20.300
ROB DODSON: From Oslo.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.050
JAKE: From Oslo.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.112
That's a long run.

00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:22.820
ROB DODSON: Yeah.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.892
SURMA: That's impressive.

00:02:23.892 --> 00:02:24.850
ROB DODSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.260
But it was really cool.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.670
I got to learn a lot
about how Chrome actually

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.080
works under the hood, so
that was really interesting.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.900
I'd actually encourage
anyone who is really

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.190
interested in the browser--

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.140
you can learn enough C++
to kind of get in there.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.921
And the nice thing is--

00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:44.180
this is a tip I got from
another person on the team--

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.970
if the code around
you is written well,

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.260
you can kind of figure it out.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.490
You can kind of muddle along.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.740
And so that's the case, right.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.880
I got in there, and
I found something

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.500
that was similar to what I
wanted to do, and kind of just

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.000
like--

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.820
SURMA: Copy, paste.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.117
ROB DODSON: Yeah.

00:02:58.117 --> 00:02:58.950
SURMA: Let's say it.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.740
It's copy, paste.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.031
JAKE: But I find the same
with web standards, actually.

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:04.070
I kind of sometimes
submit a patch,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.820
and the feedback
would be like, why

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.445
on earth have you
written it like this,

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:09.290
and I was like, well,
I copy and pasted it

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.420
from two lines that way.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.565
So, well, it's wrong.

00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:15.330
Well, I mean, how can I help
being wrong in this situation.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.705
ROB DODSON: You're
like, I'm new.

00:03:16.705 --> 00:03:22.500
And so yeah, I was very wrong
pretty much all the time.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.530
But it was pretty
gratifying, like,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.280
getting something
behind a flag in Chrome.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.613
SURMA: I mean, you're now the
owner of a flag in Chrome,

00:03:28.613 --> 00:03:29.120
right?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.010
That's the thing you wrote.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.560
ROB DODSON: Yeah.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.360
The experimental web
platform features flags,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.526
which kind of like a bucket.

00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:34.680
Everything goes in there.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.940
But yeah, I'm the owner of
a pseudo-class in CSS now.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.690
JAKE: That's cool.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.687
So what have you actually
been implementing?

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.270
ROB DODSON: So it's
a CSS pseudo-class

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.550
called Focus Visible.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.180
And the way it works is it
matches when Focus matches,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.640
and then using kind of
an internal heuristic

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.340
in the browser, we
determined that it

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.270
would be useful
for the user to see

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.520
some sort of focus indicators.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.570
So typically that
means, depending

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.760
on if they're using a
mouse versus a keyboard

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.052
to navigate the page,
if you're using a mouse,

00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:02.510
depending on the
control, maybe you

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.250
don't need to see one if
you're clicking on a button,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.930
or something like that.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.030
JAKE: Right.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.238
I've had that problem before.

00:04:06.238 --> 00:04:08.990
And I feel like I've been
making things not accessible,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.500
because I don't want, when
the user clicks with a mouse,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.700
it to have that
same focus style.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.650
You end up doing
weird hacks like,

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.490
oh, if there's a mouse down, add
a class somewhere or something

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.680
that will hide the focus
styles or something.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.550
SURMA: So it's not a thing I can
do star, focus visible, focus

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.870
ring, and then--

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.120
ROB DODSON: Well, there's no--

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.400
I mean, you just use outline.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.970
SURMA: Oh, outline.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.840
ROB DODSON: Right-- for
your focus indicator.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.270
Yeah.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.550
SURMA: That's outline,
but isn't the--

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.085
ROB DODSON: Focus visible
used to be called focus ring,

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:36.660
actually, and we renamed it.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.890
SURMA: Oh, that's
the same thing?

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.598
ROB DODSON: Yeah.

00:04:38.598 --> 00:04:41.227
SURMA: So, can I do-- because
by default, the outline

00:04:41.227 --> 00:04:42.310
is kind of blurred, right?

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.400
It fades out.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.584
Can I do that?

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:45.250
ROB DODSON: Yes.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.780
So someone was telling me
if you just do outline auto,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.420
it should revert to that, but
that actual-- so the blue thing

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.600
that you see there is in
the user agent style sheet.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.350
It's kind of cool.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.730
If you just open up--

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:01.520
what is it-- cs.chromium.org,
and type in HTML.css, that's

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.972
all the styles in the browser,
is that file, and that's

00:05:03.972 --> 00:05:06.430
the kind of thing that I kind
of got to discover on the eng

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.030
rotation, is you can just go
in there and you could be like,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.060
I can just change
this if I want.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.060
SURMA: You will see interesting
units like the QEMs--

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.922
the quirky EMs.

00:05:13.922 --> 00:05:14.630
ROB DODSON: Yeah.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.134
Weird stuff.

00:05:15.134 --> 00:05:15.800
It's just like--

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.715
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:19.352
JAKE: So when you're saying
it's heuristics-based, I mean,

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:20.810
how do you get that
for a standard?

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.900
ROB DODSON: So actually,
we're still working on that.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.316
That was some of the feedback
that we got, which was like,

00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:28.380
we want to know more about the
conformance for this thing.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.700
So we're working on a patch
right now to really explain

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.250
when we think it's beneficial.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.157
And so typically
for anything where

00:05:38.157 --> 00:05:40.490
you know the user is going
to be providing some keyboard

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.492
input, like a text field
or something like that,

00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:44.200
you probably always
want to show it then.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.000
Whereas for something where
the only action is literally

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.990
click a thing--

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.190
like a button, or a
slider knob or something--

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.050
you maybe don't want
it in those cases.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.770
So it kind of depends on the
intent of the interaction

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.770
and everything.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.860
SURMA: But in the end, it's
going to be left to the UA

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.912
to decide what--

00:05:59.912 --> 00:06:00.620
ROB DODSON: Yeah.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.290
Ultimately-- so there'll be
some conformance criteria

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.600
that we're going to recommend,
and hopefully everyone

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.411
would follow that, because you
would want it to be consistent,

00:06:08.411 --> 00:06:10.160
because otherwise it
ends up with just yet

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.800
another kind of broken
focus experience.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.300
SURMA: Yeah.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.314
That makes sense.

00:06:13.314 --> 00:06:15.480
JAKE: So you're speaking
about accessibility, right,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.570
at I/O. Is that Focus
Ring, or are you

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.950
covering other stuff as well?

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.616
ROB DODSON: Yeah, so
we're going to talk

00:06:20.616 --> 00:06:21.950
about what's new in DevTools.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.750
So there's some cool
accessibility stuff

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.270
that we've added there,
talk about Focus Visible,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.770
and then the other
thing we're going

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.422
to talk about in the second
half, Dominic Mazzoni, who

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:31.880
is an engineer on
the blink team is

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.046
going to come up and talk
about accessibility object

00:06:34.046 --> 00:06:35.080
model, which is--

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.080
SURMA: The infamous AOM.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.746
ROB DODSON: Yes.

00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:38.400
Or "ay-ahm,"
depending on how you--

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.960
SURMA: The "ay-ahm."

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.570
ROB DODSON: --depending on
the camp that you fall in.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.650
So yeah, that's actually
a way to just create

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.377
your own virtual
accessibility tree,

00:06:45.377 --> 00:06:46.460
listen for accessibility--

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.460
SURMA: Well, let's stop
there, because what even

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.880
is an accessibility tree?

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.270
ROB DODSON: Oh, OK.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.435
Yeah.

00:06:50.435 --> 00:06:51.960
So that's actually
a good question.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.459
So this is something
I didn't really

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:54.590
understand for a long time.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.230
I was like, how does the
browser make a screen reader say

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.312
the things that it says?

00:06:58.312 --> 00:07:00.270
And it was always just
kind of a mystery to me.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.340
But basically it's like
you've got your HTML--

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.350
SURMA: Which is a tree.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.470
ROB DODSON: Right.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.930
That gets turned into DOM--

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.850
which, developers are
familiar with that.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.120
But then the browser
does this one extra step,

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.200
where it takes the
DOM and it sort of

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.740
prunes out all the
parts that are not

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.781
semantically interesting.

00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:17.360
So if you've got a bunch of
divs just for positioning things

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.150
on screen, it just sort
of throws those away.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.924
It builds this sparse tree
of just the semantic goodies,

00:07:23.924 --> 00:07:25.340
and that's the
accessibility tree,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.450
and that's what
actually gets handed off

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.750
to assistive technology.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.800
JAKE: So it's if I do something
like area hidden, then that's

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.930
my instruction to say, don't put
this in the accessibility tree.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.240
ROB DODSON: Yeah, you're pruning
out a whole chunk of the DOM

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.410
from the accessibility tree.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.993
SURMA: I mean, it kind of sounds
similar, coming from the CSS,

00:07:38.993 --> 00:07:40.697
like display non--

00:07:40.697 --> 00:07:43.030
remove something from the
rendering tree, which you also

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.270
have.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.740
ROB DODSON: And also removes
it from the accessibility tree.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.239
Yeah.

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:46.410
SURMA: It's so many trees.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:46.520
ROB DODSON: Yes.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.300
There are trees
all the way down.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.310
JAKE: So we're actually
getting access to this tree?

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:49.760
ROB DODSON: Yeah.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.160
What you'll be able to do--
there's kind of a few things.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.770
You'll be able to listen to
certain events that previously

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.205
were only available through
accessible technology.

00:07:57.205 --> 00:07:58.580
And the other
thing you can do is

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.080
you can actually
just kind of create

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.880
virtual branches
of the tree if you

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.630
want I think of it that way.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.280
SURMA: That's probably
really [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.720
for like, for example,
Canvas, right?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.720
ROB DODSON: Indeed, yes.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.860
Canvas-- if you're building
WebGL, maybe some kind of SVG

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.590
that's hard to make
accessible, or maybe even just

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.487
like a regular DOM component.

00:08:14.487 --> 00:08:16.820
For the longest time, it's
been really, really difficult

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.653
in some situations where
you have something,

00:08:18.653 --> 00:08:21.760
and in Canvas, it's
almost like a black box,

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.330
but DOM it could be just
a really elaborate thing

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.780
for something presentational.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.410
But now you can just hook in
there, and you can just say,

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.220
you know what--

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:28.880
SURMA: I know better.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.180
ROB DODSON: Exactly.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.346
You're like, I know this
is all weird and elaborate,

00:08:31.346 --> 00:08:33.513
but here's the actual thing
I want to be represented

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:34.595
in the accessibility tree.

00:08:34.595 --> 00:08:36.090
SURMA: Is that pure
JavaScript API,

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.929
or are we going to
be markup as well?

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.274
ROB DODSON: It'll be pure
JavaScript, at least initially.

00:08:42.274 --> 00:08:42.940
SURMA: OK, sure.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.940
ROB DODSON: But yeah.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.120
So it'll be all JavaScript.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.950
JAKE: So one of the struggles,
I think, with accessibility

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.300
is getting developers
to care about it.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.970
And I felt like performance
is in that bucket as well.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.057
It's slightly difficult
to get budget for that,

00:08:59.057 --> 00:09:00.640
even though I would
say, well, I think

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.139
accessibility is a lot of people
who get real value from it,

00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:05.190
and with performance as well.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.760
With performance,
I feel like AMP

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.590
has done a really good job
of taking that to businesses

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.090
and saying performance
is important.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.590
SURMA: Making it
the default, right?

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.160
JAKE: Yeah.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.482
What can we do for accessibility
to achieve the same?

00:09:15.482 --> 00:09:16.190
ROB DODSON: Yeah.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.940
So it's tough, because
accessibility--

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.950
because the area is really
broad, some of things

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.500
fall into user
experience and design.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.870
So color contrast and
stuff like that, people

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.210
tend to pick that up,
and incorporate it

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.015
into their design process
a little bit better.

00:09:32.015 --> 00:09:33.640
You get into other
areas, though, like,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.805
screen reader support in
Aria, and a lot of people

00:09:35.805 --> 00:09:37.680
are like, well, that's
not my problem, right.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.050
It's sort of out of
sight, out of mind.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.010
If it's not something
that's directly

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.150
affecting the developer,
they kind of just

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.530
don't care about it.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.710
So I think what has been really
successful for a lot of teams

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.230
has been doing a more
inclusive design approach,

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.380
so making sure that
you're bringing in people

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.560
who may have disabilities or
impairments into the design

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.900
phase-- into the
product testing phase.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.680
And you know, even also making
sure that you're employing

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.180
those folks on your team, even.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.555
Engineers on your team might
have disabilities and things

00:10:04.555 --> 00:10:06.096
like that, because
if it doesn't work

00:10:06.096 --> 00:10:07.770
for literally the
engineer on the team,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.020
it's not going to ship, right.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:09.750
SURMA: Pretty much.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.583
ROB DODSON: And so we
need to just, I think,

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:14.210
in general do a better
job of including more

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.280
people in our design practice.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.280
As a result, hopefully
it just becomes something

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.874
that everyone does as
part of their daily habit.

00:10:21.874 --> 00:10:23.790
SURMA: Well, thank you
so much for joining us.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.040
ROB DODSON: Thank you
all for having me.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.874
SURMA: Good luck
with your talk, and--

00:10:28.234 --> 00:10:29.067
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:29.067 --> 00:10:30.610
I thought that was something.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.610
JAKE: You can't do that.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.780
You can't set me up, and then
look at me, and just say, and--

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.155
SURMA: You've got
to finish this.

00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:36.096
JAKE: And ta-da.

00:10:36.096 --> 00:10:38.490
ROB DODSON: I think I totally
messed you up by saying,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.490
thank you for having me.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.200
SURMA: It's fine.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:40.750
It's fine.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.500
ROB DODSON: Do you
want to try that again?

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.020
SURMA: No.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:43.180
JAKE: No.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:43.700
SURMA: We're just
going to leave this.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.360
ROB DODSON: Oh, OK.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.568
JAKE: This is ending, though.

00:10:45.568 --> 00:10:46.540
ROB DODSON: All right.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.600
All right, well,

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.640
JAKE: We're going to
keep dragging it out

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.015
like the final "Lord of the
Rings," like so many endings.

00:10:51.015 --> 00:10:53.710
ROB DODSON: Should we do a
long fist bump or something?

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:54.710
JAKE: When is your talk?

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:55.418
It's soon, right?

00:10:55.418 --> 00:10:57.960
So we're just going to go
straight-- this ending is going

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.930
to last straight into the talk.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:10:59.260
ROB DODSON: Right into the talk.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.134
OK; that's good.

00:11:00.134 --> 00:11:00.800
JAKE: All right.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.220
ROB DODSON: All right.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:01.610
JAKE: All right.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.970
ROB DODSON: All right.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:02.470
JAKE: Cool.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.120
[LAUGHTER]
