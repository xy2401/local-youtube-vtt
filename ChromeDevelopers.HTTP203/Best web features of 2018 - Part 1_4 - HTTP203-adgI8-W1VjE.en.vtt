00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:01.290
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So that puts--

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.101
sorry.

00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:02.600
Am I good?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.180
Should I go?

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.727
SPEAKER: Yeah,
whenever you're ready.

00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:05.560
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So--

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.488
SURMA: Blah.

00:00:07.488 --> 00:00:10.380
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:17.750
It's Christmas, isn't it?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.590
We do the annual
Christmas special.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.760
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, yeah.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.997
I mean, it's annual in that
this is the second year

00:00:24.997 --> 00:00:25.830
that we're doing it.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.280
I don't know--

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.380
SURMA: That
counts as annual.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.610
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
OK, it's happened.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.600
It's happening twice.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.308
SURMA: It's the
second time that I'm

00:00:31.308 --> 00:00:33.080
on "203" when it's Christmas.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.955
JAKE ARCHIBALD: True.

00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:36.512
Oh, happy birthday.

00:00:36.512 --> 00:00:38.470
It wasn't Christmas when
you started last year.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.680
SURMA: True.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.180
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
You're not, like--

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.660
SURMA: It's the second
Christmas that I'm on "203."

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.451
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:45.170
And what we did last year
is we got a bit ambitious

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.760
and we did the 12
days of Christmas.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.460
Like, we did 12 mini-episodes,
12 bits of content.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.562
So we changed it
around this time.

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:53.270
And what we decided
to do is do the World

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.730
Cup of features
that were released

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.260
or that went into
Chrome this year.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.146
SURMA: So we
did 12 last time.

00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:02.520
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, and
we're going to do 32 this time.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.170
SURMA: Great.
Bring it.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.620
Let's do it.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.790
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And we're going
to find out which one the best

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.450
is.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.100
SURMA: The best
feature of 2018.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.000
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Yes, arbitrarily,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.690
just decide [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.410
SURMA: And
basically, each feature

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.962
will have its own
10-minute video.

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:12.170
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes, exactly.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.669
No.

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:14.580
No, we're going to
try and keep it--

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.770
SURMA: Short, snappy.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.340
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And one
of the things that's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.810
going to be really annoying
for people is that--

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.620
[JINGLING]

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.922
--my jumper has bells on.

00:01:20.922 --> 00:01:22.304
It's a very Christmasy sound.

00:01:22.304 --> 00:01:24.220
But I'm also sweating
horribly in this jumper.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.180
And when I do that, it's
just wafting into my face.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.300
So I'm--

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.410
SURMA: High-quality
polyester, isn't it?

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.230
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes, it is.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.188
It's a Primark special.

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:30.560
I actually quite like this.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.190
Right.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.760
Let's dig in.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.390
SURMA: We want
to keep it short.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.050
Let's go on.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
the first feature

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.720
that I want to talk about
is Display Contents.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.420
SURMA: OK.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.277
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And this, it's--

00:01:40.277 --> 00:01:42.110
SURMA: That looks
like the title slide,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.034
but just with a CSS
wrapped around it.

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:44.950
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It is.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.449
It is.

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:46.580
Well spotted.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.910
And this is how it works.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.140
What it essentially means
is the containing element--

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.790
pretend it's not there,
in terms of layout.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.650
So if you've got a Flexbox,
and then inside it you've

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.750
got an element that has
Display Contents and that

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.640
has three children
inside it, it will

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.847
act as if that wrapper
element isn't there.

00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:05.180
They're all part of the Flexbox.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.300
SURMA: But in terms of
CSS, you still respect that--

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.620
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Absolutely, yes.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.350
SURMA: --wrapping element.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.880
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes, good point.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.390
SURMA: That's where
the good stuff comes in

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.098
because you can write--
you can basically

00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:15.590
encapsulate the elements
and style them differently.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.047
But in terms of layout, they
just bubble up, kind of.

00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:19.880
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.710
So you might want an
element there for semantics,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.410
but you want the children to
be part of a Flexbox or a grid.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.850
This is how you do it.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.530
SURMA: All right, so facing
off against that feature is--

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.280
and the feature that
I want to talk about.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.140
And it is Reporting Observer.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.390
JAKE ARCHIBALD: All right, OK.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.110
SURMA: So
Reporting Observer--

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.570
I'm trying remember if I
have a code sample for this.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.660
So Reporting Observer,
it looks like many

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.460
of the other observers
that we have.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.890
It basically gives you a report
for any kind of deprecated API

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.660
that you're using
or for interventions

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.114
that you have triggered.

00:02:52.114 --> 00:02:53.780
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK,
so is this like when

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.694
we block document.writes.

00:02:55.694 --> 00:02:57.110
SURMA: You
would get an entry

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.190
in the Reporting Observer
describing to you that you have

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.630
a reporter-type intervention.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.525
You will get the description
and where in your source

00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:05.150
it got triggered,
why it got triggered,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.315
like, a lot of detail.

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:08.690
And then you can decide to
send it through your analytics

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.340
or do something with it.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.423
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Excellent.

00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:13.490
So is it just all
of them by default?

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.150
Is that right?

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.470
Or is there anything-- this
doesn't look like there's

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.220
much configuration here.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.615
SURMA: None.

00:03:16.615 --> 00:03:18.031
As far as I know,
there's nothing.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.537
It's just whenever you
use a deprecate API

00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:23.120
or you trigger an intervention,
you will get a report in here.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.900
JAKE ARCHIBALD: All right.
SURMA: That's it.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.560
JAKE ARCHIBALD: All right.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.160
OK.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.190
So we'll face these off
against each other, then.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.670
And I've been developing--

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.570
I say developing.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.920
I went to a website that
offers this feature already.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.003
SURMA: Challenge.com.

00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:37.560
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.744
And I've set it all up.

00:03:38.744 --> 00:03:39.910
SURMA: Oh, look at you.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: For reals.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.240
SURMA: Well done.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.490
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, I did
a lot of copy and pasting.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.920
So let's talk about
these two, then.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.430
Do you have any
initial feelings?

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.290
SURMA: No.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.050
So Reporting Observer's
probably incredibly useful,

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.330
but only for sites that
actually go to production

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.000
and actually work
for a business.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.030
Because on my hobby sites,
my little side projects,

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.530
I'm not going to care.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.430
So Display Contents seems more
useful to me as a developer.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.480
JAKE ARCHIBALD: To a
wider set of developers,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.300
maybe Reporting
Observer's going to be

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.805
more useful to big companies--

00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:13.930
SURMA: And businesses.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.800
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --that
track these things.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.220
SURMA: Or not even big
companies, just businesses,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.410
right?

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.730
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Do you know what?

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.104
I am going to agree with you.

00:04:18.104 --> 00:04:19.020
SURMA: All right.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.560
So we're going to declare
Display Contents the winner.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.393
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:25.820
SURMA: The first round of
the Christmas 2018 203 World

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.044
Cup of Web Features.

00:04:27.044 --> 00:04:28.460
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Oh, that was good.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.670
I imagined you regretted
starting that sentence

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.712
as you went through it.

00:04:32.712 --> 00:04:34.670
SURMA: So we now
see, in the next bracket,

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.099
we will face it off against--

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:38.390
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Something else.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.250
SURMA: --something else,
which is totally not on screen

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.940
right now.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.490
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, it's
a bit of spoilers there.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.840
SURMA: Spoiler alert.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.190
That's it.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.520
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So that is
what I'm going to talk about.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.250
I'm going to talk
about Scroll Snap.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.000
SURMA: Mm, Scroll
Snap is a good one.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.875
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:49.945
So it looks like this.

00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:52.075
And here we go.

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:53.450
SURMA: It's
a great feature.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.630
I really dislike how
we did it in CSS.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.321
It's--

00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:57.820
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh,
what would you--

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.403
SURMA: I don't
really dislike it.

00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:02.090
I find it really hard to
have an intuition for it.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.830
Like, I have to look it up and
see what x mandatory-- like,

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.070
what is mandatory about this?

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.840
And then Scroll
Snap [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.770
I get it.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.630
Once I've read it, I understand
why we need all these options.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.944
But in terms of the
choice of words,

00:05:16.944 --> 00:05:18.110
it feels alien a little bit.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.050
But that's fine.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.770
It's a good feature to have.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.610
It's an important
feature to have.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.401
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It is
a high-level feature.

00:05:22.401 --> 00:05:23.810
SURMA: Yeah.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.310
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Let's
actually demo what it does.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.340
So you can see here,
the element is always

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.524
appearing in the middle, even
if I try to make it not do that.

00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:33.440
And this is essentially
what Scroll Snap does.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.510
SURMA: This is, like,
the standard gallery example,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.030
right?

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.900
Like the carousel where you want
to really center on the image.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.910
Oh, it's a big element.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.430
I like it.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.970
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.
So it handles that as well.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.760
I imagine it would
be useful for,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.000
like, on Twitter,
where you have a list,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.590
but you want to
swipe horizontally

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.620
onto a different kind of list.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.245
SURMA: The
different panels, yeah.

00:05:51.245 --> 00:05:54.230
That's a very common native
design layout, I think.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.190
And it was always hard to do it.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.280
So that's basically that,
which is pretty cool.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.040
So facing off-- I already
forgot what was on the bracket,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.480
but-- oh, Site Isolation.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.420
It doesn't have the code
sample because literally, it

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.750
doesn't affect how you
write code, really, at all.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.684
It's a security feature more
for the end user of browsers.

00:06:13.684 --> 00:06:14.600
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.620
SURMA: And now
you can actually

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.340
correct me because you know more
about Site Isolation than I do.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.080
But as far as I know, you
don't write code differently,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.120
except maybe an
HTP header that you

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.270
add to up into a even
stronger Site Isolation,

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.630
but that's all that
it really changes.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.890
But it is a good or really
important security feature.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.842
And yet, it is our tool
against Spectre and Meltdown.

00:06:34.842 --> 00:06:36.050
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes, exactly.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.590
The idea of every separate site
should live in its own process,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.670
it's something that kind
of happened in Chrome 1.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.920
But it didn't quite
happen with IFrames,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.670
that you'd end up with multiple
sites in the same process.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.045
SURMA: And as a side
remark, because of this, we now

00:06:49.045 --> 00:06:51.772
have out of [INAUDIBLE]
iframes are [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:51.772 --> 00:06:52.980
That's, like, a side product.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.230
And [INAUDIBLE] are, actually,
in a way, a performance

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.242
primitive because
it blocks IFrames

00:06:57.242 --> 00:06:59.450
from affecting the performance
of the top level site.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.840
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Absolutely.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.423
SURMA: And you
can actually abuse

00:07:01.423 --> 00:07:03.572
that to build little
performance containers

00:07:03.572 --> 00:07:05.030
and run multiple
things [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.350
without affecting
the top level site.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.905
JAKE ARCHIBALD: As long as all
of your browsers do it, which--

00:07:07.905 --> 00:07:08.820
SURMA: Which they don't.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.130
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well,
but they are going to.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.120
SURMA: They're
working on it.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.578
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
This is interesting

00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:14.210
that this is not
just a Chrome thing.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.220
Chrome has shown that
this is the right thing

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.095
to do, security-wise.

00:07:17.095 --> 00:07:18.761
SURMA: It's the
only sensible thing

00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:20.480
to do in a Meltdown
and Spectre world.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.480
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.130
Exactly.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.955
Well, this is a hard choice.

00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:27.830
SURMA: I mean, we
have to kind of define

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.350
what we're looking for-- the
best feature, best developer

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.060
feature.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.060
And these are actually
two really good features.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.935
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:07:34.935 --> 00:07:37.010
So we're talking
about a CSS feature

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.740
that people have
wanted for ages.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.190
It's a really nice high level
feature with great performance

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.300
and all that.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.640
And we're facing
it off against what

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.644
is saving people from being
hacked and losing their data.

00:07:49.644 --> 00:07:52.060
SURMA: Yeah, I'm going
to go with Scroll Snap points.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.059
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Are you?

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:53.870
SURMA: Yes.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.417
But that's because I feel like
this is a web development show,

00:07:57.417 --> 00:07:58.250
and I kind of like--

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.750
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
It's what developers

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.920
will care more about.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.632
SURMA: And because it
doesn't affect development

00:08:03.632 --> 00:08:05.090
pretty much at all,
Site Isolation.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.595
It's just we need it.

00:08:06.595 --> 00:08:07.220
It's important.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.386
But it's just something
that we need in the browser.

00:08:09.386 --> 00:08:11.762
There's nothing a developer
can do or can enhance for me.

00:08:11.762 --> 00:08:13.677
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So it's
not really a developer

00:08:13.677 --> 00:08:15.080
facing feature,
so we could maybe

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.451
disqualify it on those grounds?

00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:17.450
SURMA: Pretty much.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.870
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Agreed.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:18.911
SURMA: Look at that.

00:08:18.911 --> 00:08:21.800
We have to first
second round face off.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.960
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.280
So we've got here Display
Contents versus Scroll Snaps.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.240
SURMA: This is
an easy one, honestly.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.198
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Really?

00:08:27.198 --> 00:08:28.340
SURMA: Yeah.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.846
I like Display Contents,
but it's not that exciting.

00:08:30.846 --> 00:08:31.970
I don't need it that often.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.265
Scroll Snaps, however--

00:08:33.265 --> 00:08:35.640
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I've wanted
Display Contents quite a bit.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.850
And I feel like I've sometimes
broken HTML semantics

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.789
because it wasn't there,
because I couldn't

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.232
put the correct wrapper
around something because I

00:08:46.232 --> 00:08:48.440
wanted it to be in the
Flexbox with the other things.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.898
SURMA: I guess I have a
very low threshold [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:50.898 --> 00:08:52.364
breaking semantic
markup, honestly.

00:08:52.364 --> 00:08:54.780
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But Scroll
Snap is quite snazzy, isn't it?

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.670
SURMA: It is very snazzy.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:56.540
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It looks fancy.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.170
SURMA: It looks fancy.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.820
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Should
we put it through?

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.921
SURMA: I'm-- yeah.

00:08:58.921 --> 00:08:59.420
Yeah.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:08:59.990
JAKE ARCHIBALD: All right.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.970
OK, I'm putting
Scroll Snap through.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.230
This is a decision being made.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.060
There we go.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.470
SURMA: Will it update?

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.720
This is like a little
mini [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.120
Oh.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.860
JAKE ARCHIBALD: There we go.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.920
SURMA: Even [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.460
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
lovely, isn't it?

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.160
SURMA: Well done, yeah.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.540
All right.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.340
JAKE ARCHIBALD: All right.
So we're--

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.700
SURMA: Going back.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.300
Your turn.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.299
JAKE ARCHIBALD: My turn.

00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:18.230
I would like to talk
about Named Workers.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.690
This is a big hitter.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.222
You ready?

00:09:20.222 --> 00:09:20.930
SURMA: I am.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:21.440
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Are you ready?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.731
SURMA: Show me the syntax.

00:09:22.731 --> 00:09:24.460
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Strap in.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.045
SURMA: It's a
worker with a name.

00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:26.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.586
Who could have predicted
this happening?

00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:30.160
SURMA: What
does this name do?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.160
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Nothing.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.050
No.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.220
No, it does do things.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.240
It will improve things
like stack traces.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.910
It will improve
things like DevTools,

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.830
especially if you've
got multiple instances

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.130
of the same URL.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.554
It's a way to
differentiate them.

00:09:46.554 --> 00:09:47.470
SURMA: All right.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.010
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, that's it.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.909
SURMA: Oh,
cool, I think, maybe.

00:09:50.909 --> 00:09:52.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It is
a feature [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.730
SURMA: What do we
pitch in against it?

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.890
Payment Handler.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.280
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.630
SURMA: Disclaimer--

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.570
I literally had not looked into
a Payment Request and Payment

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.090
Handler, which are
interacting with each other.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.784
And this is not my territory.

00:10:06.784 --> 00:10:08.700
This is AG, and AG you
would know all about it

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.570
and would get super excited.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.420
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes,
our colleague, AG.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.410
SURMA: And I don't--

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.493
I have never done payment.

00:10:12.493 --> 00:10:16.210
Like, never written a store
on the web, or maintained one,

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.680
or had my living depend on it.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.385
So I'm guessing many
people are excited.

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:21.600
But I actually didn't
get it to work.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.100
Either way.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.070
So here's roughly how it works.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.592
And it might be
wrong a little bit.

00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:26.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK, OK.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.806
SURMA: So you can do
payment requests on the web,

00:10:28.806 --> 00:10:29.680
to request a payment.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.530
And then the browser
basically intervenes

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.030
like, hey, I'm going to do like
a very trusted [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.630
You don't write.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.220
But the browser
actually has built in,

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.720
and you can select
your credit cards

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:43.190
or pay with Google or with
Apple Pay, all these things.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.740
But what if I want to pay
with some totally legit bank?

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.854
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I don't.

00:10:48.854 --> 00:10:50.020
It sounds really suspicious.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.020
SURMA: But I do
because it's totally legit.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.740
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK, excellent.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.711
SURMA: And that is
what's Payment Handler allow

00:10:57.711 --> 00:10:58.210
you to do.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.880
Like, you can now write your own
Payment Handler and basically

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.030
hook into this machinery
in the browser.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.494
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
this is rather than--

00:11:05.494 --> 00:11:07.660
this allows someone like
PayPal to do this without--

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.980
SURMA: I'm guessing PayPal
is already popular enough

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.170
to already be built into
most browsers, for example.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.920
But this would allow
the more niche sites,

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.550
maybe some Bitcoin sites
or cryptocurrencies,

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.274
to do these kind of payments.

00:11:17.274 --> 00:11:18.190
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.648
SURMA: And
the way it works is

00:11:19.648 --> 00:11:21.580
that basically you take
the service worker,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.770
and you register
a Payment Handler.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.667
And you set your domain and
your clear name and your method.

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:30.250
I'm not quite sure
what the difference

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.830
between the first key
and the method name is,

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.490
but it's code from
more or less the guide.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.264
And then you have a new
Payment Request Handler.

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:40.180
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.440
SURMA: And basically,
what you're doing here,

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.815
in all the samples
I've seen, you

00:11:42.815 --> 00:11:46.180
do a very long running
respond with handler where

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.090
you launch a new
window and guide

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.920
the users for your
own payment flow,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.100
and then you resolve
the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.330
You say, yep, the
person has paid.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.090
And now the other side can--

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And that
can include bits of UI

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.020
if [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.010
SURMA: All
these things, yeah.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.593
So this is obviously
super [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:02.332
because I didn't fully
understand it in the short time

00:12:02.332 --> 00:12:03.790
that I tried to
read everything up.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.874
But this is kind of like
a big step towards making

00:12:06.874 --> 00:12:09.040
all of these payment
interfaces more open on the web

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.720
and everybody can
hook into that.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Fair enough.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.180
Let's have a look at
the board for this.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.130
Now, what we're doing
here is we're facing off

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:24.760
payment handlers, which really
brings the web up to par

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.920
with what Native could do.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.170
SURMA: Yeah, pretty much.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.850
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
obviously, payments

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.200
are a huge part of the web.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.690
We're facing off against
workers with a name.

00:12:34.102 --> 00:12:35.810
Just shall I put
Payment Handler through?

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.270
SURMA: Yeah, let's
put Payment Handler through

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.350
because let's be honest.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.422
The named workers are--

00:12:40.422 --> 00:12:42.130
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I
mean, we have to stress

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.740
that we're not diminishing
any features that people

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.510
have worked on.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.080
These are all important things.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.080
It's great to have all
of these in the platform.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.816
They became part of the
platform for a reason.

00:12:52.816 --> 00:12:54.920
But I just think Payment
Handler's a bit bigger.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.990
SURMA: Some features
are bigger than others,

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.840
and that's OK.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.460
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Excellent.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.900
SURMA: Payment
Handlers has won this round.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.595
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yep.
SURMA: So let's see--

00:12:59.595 --> 00:13:00.370
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yep,
excellent stuff.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.470
SURMA: --what it will be
pitched against in round 2.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.400
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Now, if you
notice, something different

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:03.550
here.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.540
SURMA: Oh, that's
a nice background.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.123
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
a nice background

00:13:06.123 --> 00:13:08.630
because I want to talk
about Conic Gradients.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.750
SURMA: Is it
conic or conic?

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.605
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:13:11.605 --> 00:13:12.520
It is one of those.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.615
I thought It was conic.

00:13:13.615 --> 00:13:14.240
SURMA: No.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:14.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Conic.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.128
SURMA: I mean, I'm the--

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:17.250
I don't-- you know?

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:17.800
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
I'm from the North.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.326
I can't speak
English either, so--

00:13:19.326 --> 00:13:20.200
SURMA: So great.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.520
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.020
This is--

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.310
SURMA: I mean, the
syntax is probably well

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.870
known by everyone
because everybody

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.530
wanted to have this feature for
I don't know how many decades.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:28.840
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.070
SURMA: And now
it's finally shipped.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.970
Now we have custom
paint, but we could

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.596
have implemented it ourselves.

00:13:33.596 --> 00:13:34.720
Now it's shipped in Chrome.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.349
Cool.

00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:36.640
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yep, beautiful.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:36.980
Yep.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.750
That's all I want
to say about it.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.291
SURMA: It's
literally beautiful.

00:13:39.291 --> 00:13:41.180
And I'm pitching it
against AV1 Decoding.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.010
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.960
Triangle 1 decoding.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.097
I thought we might--

00:13:45.097 --> 00:13:46.930
I thought I'd give it
a fancy font because I

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.009
thought it would be nice.

00:13:48.009 --> 00:13:48.800
SURMA: Mostly.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.900
But this is, I guess,
a [INAUDIBLE] case

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.190
where it kind of unreadable.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.180
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
It's not very nice.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:52.590
SURMA: No, it's not.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.381
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:55.960
SURMA: So AV1 is a
upcoming, being worked on,

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.990
I think almost stable at
this point, video codex that

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.830
is completely free and open.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.790
Anybody can use
it, no royalties.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.840
And it is extremely impressive
in how efficient it is.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.740
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.950
SURMA: And so Chrome
now has support for it.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.260
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And it's
all open source as well.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.350
SURMA: Yeah, the
encoders, the decoders.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.150
JAKE ARCHIBALD: The
collaboration between Apple--

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.480
SURMA: Everything.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.400
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --and everyone.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.060
SURMA: There's a committee
around it and everything.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.280
That said, so Chrome
does support it.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.190
But obviously, we now need
hardware to decode it faster,

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.350
which most hardware doesn't
have because it's just

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.130
been standardized so it's
not been put into hardware.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.020
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
because of the complexity,

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:29.560
it's actually quite--

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:29.830
SURMA: Yeah.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.285
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
difficult. Well, it'd

00:14:31.285 --> 00:14:31.610
be a battery problem with

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:31.780
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.154
SURMA: I wonder if you
can put it with, like, GPGPU.

00:14:34.154 --> 00:14:35.830
Like, use the GPU to decode it.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:36.350
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, I see.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.540
SURMA: But I don't
know how that works.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.770
This is not my territory.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.524
I am quite excited
about the format.

00:14:41.524 --> 00:14:43.190
But I haven't played
around with it much

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.180
because it's just so new.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.096
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:14:45.096 --> 00:14:47.670
Well, thanks for
doing some research.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.290
Sorry.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.440
SURMA: That was
thanks for coming.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.862
Get out of here.

00:14:52.862 --> 00:14:55.070
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You're going
to throw that back at me

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.530
in some of the future things.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.124
I think this is quite a--

00:15:00.124 --> 00:15:02.540
it's another tough one because
we're once again facing off

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.040
quite a high-level feature that
developers have been wanting

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.810
for ages with a
huge leap forward

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.372
in not only open standards,
but in video technology.

00:15:11.372 --> 00:15:12.080
SURMA: Yeah.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.230
So I personally am going to
side with Conic Gradients, Conic

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.977
Gradients.

00:15:17.977 --> 00:15:20.310
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think people
are going to use it more.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.097
SURMA: Format adoption
is always a hassle.

00:15:23.097 --> 00:15:24.180
It's always sort of like--

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.471
YouTube's going to adopt it
straight up, sure, and then

00:15:26.471 --> 00:15:28.560
detect if your browser
supports it and ship that.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.100
Great.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.740
But for me as a
developer, it's cool.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.149
But then it's going to
take probably ages, again,

00:15:34.149 --> 00:15:35.190
for browsers to adopt it.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.651
Well, [INAUDIBLE]
was open as well.

00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:39.150
And it took such a long time
for other browsers to adopt it.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.000
I know that one is more detailed
and more nuances to the story.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.124
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Absolutely.

00:15:43.124 --> 00:15:45.420
SURMA: But
I'll believe it when

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.740
I see it is my stance on AV1,
while Conic Gradients are

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.180
something that I use--

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.430
would have used a
lot on my websites.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.971
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I
think that's right.

00:15:54.971 --> 00:15:56.190
I think once AV1 lands--

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.140
when I do video
stuff on the web,

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.420
I tend to just dump it
on YouTube or some--

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.190
on Vimeo or some
similar service.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.470
I don't have a lot of
contact with the codex.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.320
So I think what
I would encounter

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.610
more is Conic Gradients.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.550
So let's put that through.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.861
Okey dokey.

00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:13.360
Right.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.460
And there it goes.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.510
SURMA: Thanks for
pushing the button.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.139
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No
problem, no problem.

00:16:17.139 --> 00:16:17.930
Let's take a look--

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:18.056
SURMA: Wait.

00:16:18.056 --> 00:16:20.160
Shouldn't we do the
thingamajig match-up?

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, you-- yes.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.320
We should.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:22.920
Exactly.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.590
Oh, we've got a couple of
rounds to do, haven't we?

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.620
SURMA: Oh,
we're rippling up.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.630
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
we're now facing off

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.479
Payment Handler with Conic--

00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:31.020
SURMA: Oh, that
feels so unfair.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.620
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --Gradients.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.750
SURMA: That feels
really unfair to--

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.850
Payment Handler
seems really hard

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.800
and longstanding standards work.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.230
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And it is one of
those things that is going to--

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.802
so many things are
leaving the web

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:46.260
because payments is harder on
the web than it is on native.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.344
And this brings them back.

00:16:47.344 --> 00:16:49.593
SURMA: In that sense,
it's so crucial for the web

00:16:49.593 --> 00:16:51.640
to survive to have these
kind of things there.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.466
On the other hand--

00:16:52.466 --> 00:16:54.840
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No one's made
money from Conic Gradients.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.070
SURMA: No, but I'm still
more excited about them.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.486
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
And do you know, I

00:16:58.486 --> 00:17:01.050
am going to agree with you,
using the consistent logic

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:01.967
of what we did before.

00:17:01.967 --> 00:17:04.216
Payment Handler is something
that a few web developers

00:17:04.216 --> 00:17:05.099
are going to use.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:06.150
SURMA: Yeah.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.859
And in that case, it's actually
the even more niche version

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:08.910
of Payment Handlers.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.470
It's not even Payment Request.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.949
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That
is a good point.

00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:12.420
SURMA: It's
Payment Handlers.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.336
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:17:13.336 --> 00:17:13.869
Right.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.040
SURMA: So we're going
to go with Conic Gradients.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.800
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.
Right.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.300
I'm going to press
the button for Conic--

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.069
I'm pretty sure it's Conic--

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:21.192
but Conic Gradients.

00:17:21.192 --> 00:17:21.900
And do you know--

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.316
SURMA: And
so end up with two

00:17:23.316 --> 00:17:25.051
CSS features in the next round.

00:17:25.051 --> 00:17:27.300
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And we can
face these two off as well.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.844
So I'm going to give
it to Scroll Snap.

00:17:29.844 --> 00:17:31.510
I just think it's
going to be used more.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.843
SURMA: I straight up agree.

00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:33.615
It's visual.

00:17:33.615 --> 00:17:36.411
Conic Gradients, you can usually
solve with an SVG background

00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:36.910
image.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.610
There's many workarounds
that are just as efficient.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:39.830
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You could
use Canvas if necessary.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.955
SURMA: Canvas, CSS
Paint, there's many things.

00:17:41.955 --> 00:17:45.360
Scroll Snap, it's always
has been main thread bound

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.920
and weird, ugly Javascript.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.330
You have to do all the
velocity and physics

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.330
implementation that the
operating system usually

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.380
already has.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.345
It is such a big tool
for web developers.

00:17:54.345 --> 00:17:55.220
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Sold.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:55.930
Right.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.020
Yes.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.820
So that puts Scroll Snap
into the semifinals.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.226
SURMA: Interesting.

00:18:01.226 --> 00:18:03.225
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So I think
we should stop there.

00:18:03.225 --> 00:18:05.060
SURMA: Yeah, and keep
the rest for the next episode.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.560
JAKE ARCHIBALD: For
another episode.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.010
Payments is something
that a few web develop--

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.704
a few, few--

00:18:10.704 --> 00:18:11.620
SURMA: Wallalump.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Conic
Gradients is something--

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.284
Payment Handler is--

00:18:16.284 --> 00:18:18.075
SURMA: Thank you
for speaking English.

00:18:18.075 --> 00:18:19.241
JAKE ARCHIBALD: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:19.241 --> 00:18:22.010
I try that again, I reckon.
