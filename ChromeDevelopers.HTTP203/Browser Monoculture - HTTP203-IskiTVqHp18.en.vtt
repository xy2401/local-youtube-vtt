00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:01.400
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm so tired.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.100
PAUL LEWIS: Really?

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.975
Why are you so tired?

00:00:02.975 --> 00:00:03.710
Well, I--

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.000
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I wonder why.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.250
Could it have been
the 11 hour flight?

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.800
Maybe.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.728
Yeah, it could have been that.

00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:12.218
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:19.092
PAUL LEWIS: What are you doing?

00:00:19.092 --> 00:00:20.800
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I got
myself a Diet Coke.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.670
And it was a wrong move.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.970
I need to convert this.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.662
I've got, like--

00:00:24.662 --> 00:00:26.120
PAUL LEWIS: You've
got the jitters?

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.820
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
I've got flying--

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.830
PAUL LEWIS: Adding
sugar to the jitters

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.582
is not necessarily going to--

00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:31.209
JAKE ARCHIBALD: This
is going to be OK.

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:35.630
Oh, you know, it's
actually really nice.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.026
PAUL LEWIS: Anyway, we
should talk about the web.

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:38.900
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.240
OK, so I was upset by something
that happened a few months ago.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.454
Do you remember when--

00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:48.620
PAUL LEWIS: Did it result
in an argument on Twitter?

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.900
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, I
actually kept this to myself.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.530
I just got sad inside of
myself, and I held it in.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.059
And this is me now
letting it out.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.600
PAUL LEWIS: You've
got to let it out.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.700
Because it can bring other
problems in your life.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.075
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:04.060
So Microsoft, with
the user voice thing

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.240
where they were
asking people, hey,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.679
what do you want us to work on?

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:08.595
PAUL LEWIS: Yes, I do.

00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:09.820
I liked that, by the way.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.590
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think that
was brilliant, actually.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.810
We should probably do that.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.440
One of the things that
shot to the top of the list

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.634
was, stop doing what you're
doing and just use WebKit.

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:21.300
PAUL LEWIS: Boo.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.740
No, that's not-- I don't think
that's the right outcome.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.687
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But
just the idea of them

00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:27.270
stopping what they're
doing and taking

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.500
on another browsing engine,
that made me really sad.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.410
Because I really think it's the
diversity of browsing engines

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.780
which makes the
internet a better place.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.470
PAUL LEWIS: Well, we had this
when we fought to make Blink.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.590
It wasn't about one code base.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.650
One code base is
not what you want.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.350
Because then you end
up with stagnation.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.720
What you want is standards.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.220
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But
I can understand

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.110
why developers might want,
like, a single browsing engine.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.660
Because it can be
a pain sometimes,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.190
especially when you
develop a thing,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.926
your wonderful work of art
in a couple of browsers.

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:00.300
And then you go
to the third one,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.280
and it's turned
it into some kind

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.107
of expressionist
modern art piece.

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:05.690
PAUL LEWIS: Yep I
can understand that.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.689
JAKE ARCHIBALD: When I
was working at a startup,

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.070
I had a series of Post-it
notes on the wall,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.277
one for each browser.

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:13.110
PAUL LEWIS: Of what?

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.480
Like things to
avoid or things to--

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.830
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, no, no.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.163
It was just Post-it note
Internet Explorer, Post-it note

00:02:17.163 --> 00:02:18.520
Safari, Firefox, Opera.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.210
PAUL LEWIS: Was it to remind
you to test in the browser?

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.850
Is that what it was?

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.440
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, it was
I because I'd be coding--

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.500
PAUL LEWIS: Why did you have
the list of Post-it notes?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.750
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, if you
would shut up for a moment,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.910
I might be able to tell you.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.743
PAUL LEWIS: I don't
like this jet lag, Jake.

00:02:28.743 --> 00:02:30.780
We're not nice people
when we're jet lagged.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.071
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I had one
for each browser on the wall.

00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:35.280
And then when my
wonderful work was

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.370
destroyed by a particular
browser, I would-- [GRUMBLING].

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.750
But rather than
getting really angry,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.620
I would just calmly stand
up, pick up a Sharpie,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.950
walk over to the
appropriate Post-it note,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.620
and just draw a tiny phallus.

00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:52.100
PAUL LEWIS: I really,
genuinely thought

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.590
it was going to be a
grown up little checkmark.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.730
If you found out
that it was your bug,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.891
did you apply the
appropriate diagram to self?

00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:01.640
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Just
to my own face, yeah.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.559
PAUL LEWIS: Right.

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.600
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Because
this was back in the day.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.240
PAUL LEWIS: Back in the day,
and you've grown up since then.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.900
You wouldn't do
that now, would you?

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.290
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, I
still would do this.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.373
But here's the difference.

00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:12.940
Back then, the Internet
Explorer Post-it note was--

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.481
PAUL LEWIS: Did you
run out of space?

00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:17.320
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It was riddled,
absolutely riddled, mate.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.180
But I do think modern day
Internet Explorer has really

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.896
turned over a leaf.

00:03:23.896 --> 00:03:25.270
So that's made me
really sad when

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.640
people were sort of really
wanting a browsing monoculture.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.429
Because we did have it
with IE6 at the time.

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:33.470
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, we did.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.220
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
it was actually awful.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.765
Because the web stagnated.

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:39.970
We had a complete lack
of progress for years.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.620
The diversity in
browsers, it actually

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.960
gives developers more power.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.110
Because if you're in a
monoculture-- like say everyone

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.990
went WebKit.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.210
Who gets to decide what
features get implemented?

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.190
PAUL LEWIS: Oh yeah, no,
this is the stagnation.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.780
This is the monoculture
thing, right?

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.512
This is exactly.

00:03:54.512 --> 00:03:56.720
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, it
will be WebKit that decides.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.110
In the same way that
on native platforms,

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.050
like it's Android that decides
what features get developed.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.340
And I'm feeling this with
Service Worker at the moment.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.030
I know, right?

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.160
I know everything's
Service Worker with me.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.710
PAUL LEWIS: Hello,
one trick pony.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.460
How have you been?

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.164
It's only been half a
day since we last spoke.

00:04:11.164 --> 00:04:12.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.019
But at the moment,
it's in Chrome.

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.560
And it's going to
be in Firefox soon.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.089
And Internet Explorer
looked like they were

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.310
going to take it on as well.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.079
But Apple we don't know.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.260
But it puts developers in
this position of power.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.190
Because if they can make sites
work faster in Chrome, Firefox,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.540
and eventually IE, then Apple
are going to look at that.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.855
And they have to go, well,
we're not going to have this.

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:35.230
PAUL LEWIS: We're not going
to be the rubbishist in town.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.660
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.120
So we're going to have to
implement Service Worker.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.900
And the people that made us do
that is real world developers.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.670
PAUL LEWIS: It's brilliant.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.760
More power to developers.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.634
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:45.770
And that's what multiple
browser engines give us.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.820
