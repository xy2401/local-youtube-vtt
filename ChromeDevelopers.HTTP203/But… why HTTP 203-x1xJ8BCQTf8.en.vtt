00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.720
SURMA: So how did you end up
calling it HTTP 203 anyway?

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.760
JAKE: Well, it was just
better than the alternatives.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.732
So Surma, you've been
looking at import maps.

00:00:08.732 --> 00:00:10.690
SURMA: Yes, so I've been
looking at input maps.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:25.110
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.890
JAKE: So

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.150
SURMA: So.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.110
JAKE: So.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.860
SURMA: So.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.360
JAKE: So.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.890
SURMA: So.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.070
JAKE: So.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.570
SURMA: So.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.650
JAKE: So.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.290
SURMA: So.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.790
JAKE: So.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.290
SURMA: So.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.280
JAKE: As well as this,
we do a podcast as well.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.080
So the podcast is
like this but longer.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.490
SURMA: So if you prefer
our voices to our faces,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.640
we also do a podcast.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.973
JAKE: And this is something
we discussed in the podcast.

00:00:45.973 --> 00:00:48.270
SURMA: If you like podcasts,
we do one of these.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.860
So what have you been up to?

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.870
JAKE: So I've been
taking a little look at--

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.608
[FAST FORWARD]

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:12.551
How do you handle cases where
the layout becomes recursive?

00:01:15.497 --> 00:01:18.434
Surma?

00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:18.934
Surma?

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.410
Ready to go?

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.910
SURMA: Yeah.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.440
JAKE: Cool.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.310
SPEAKER: So wait
one minute, guys.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.500
How long is this going to be?

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.190
JAKE: About 15 minutes.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.690
SPEAKER: No.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.190
Show's up.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.830
Make it shorter.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.890
SURMA: Why?

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.740
SPEAKER: We've got, like,
two minutes [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.873
JAKE: It's not going to work.

00:01:49.873 --> 00:01:51.290
SPEAKER: Cut!

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.480
SURMA: So you looked a bit
and played with Web GL, right?

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.120
JAKE: No, you're
doing this episode.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.660
SURMA: No, it's your turn.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.410
JAKE: I've never--

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.660
I've never done Web GL before.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.630
You have done Web GL?

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.130
SURMA: What?

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.100
A bit.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.770
JAKE: So you do the episode.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.580
SURMA: I-- I have
literally nothing prepared.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.738
JAKE: Well, neither do I.

00:02:08.738 --> 00:02:10.280
SPEAKER: Is this
part of the episode?

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.540
JAKE: No!

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.180
SURMA: No!

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.100
SPEAKER: Cut.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.558
SURMA: So what have
you been up to?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.034
Are you OK?

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.010
Jake?

00:02:32.762 --> 00:02:34.720
JAKE: So you've run some
performance benchmarks

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.450
on this, right?

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.950
SURMA: Yeah.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.343
So um-- [BLEEP]
did perfectly fine.

00:02:39.343 --> 00:02:40.010
It was all good.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.950
Ran fast.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.390
[BLEEP] really
good, really fast.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.580
This [BLEEP] browser, Chrome,
really completely useless.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.080
JAKE: What?

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.138
SURMA: It was, like,
20 million seconds.

00:02:49.138 --> 00:02:50.180
JAKE: 20 million seconds?

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.210
SURMA: 20 million seconds.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.710
JAKE: So.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.260
SURMA: So.
