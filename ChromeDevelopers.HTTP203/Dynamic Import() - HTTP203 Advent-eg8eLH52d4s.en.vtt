00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.580
SURMA: 2017 is a year
that is almost done.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.870
And we are about to enter 2018.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.170
And so I was thinking about
what I want to do in 2018

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.450
and what I am excited about.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.940
And I thought I
would let you ask

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.460
me questions about one thing I'm
excited about in two minutes.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.210
JAKE: Two minutes.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.710
OK.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.210
Go.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.600
SURMA: The import function.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.100
JAKE: OK.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.252
It's a function.

00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:31.460
SURMA: Well, technically, no.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.030
But that's a different story.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.490
JAKE: What?

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.810
You've already lied to me in
one of the words you said.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.510
SURMA: I know.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.010
JAKE: OK.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.300
SURMA: So we have static
imports in JavaScript.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.732
JAKE: Yes, we do, in modules.

00:00:39.732 --> 00:00:41.856
SURMA: So we say import
blah, blah, blah from blah,

00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:42.110
blah, blah.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.193
And then you get a module.

00:00:43.193 --> 00:00:44.090
And you can use it.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.405
JAKE: Yes.

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:44.946
SURMA: Great.

00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:47.240
But sometimes, you don't
want to do it at the start.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.270
JAKE: Right, because right
now, all your important modules

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.530
have to download
before any of them run.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.030
SURMA: Yeah.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.390
Exactly.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.650
JAKE: OK.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.899
SURMA: And sometimes you
have something like a spinner

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.102
that you want to use.

00:00:57.102 --> 00:00:59.310
But you don't only block
the execution of your module

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.770
on loading the spinner
which you're going

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.110
to use much later or something.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.610
JAKE: OK.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.459
So this idea is this
is something that you

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.606
can defer the loading of.

00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:06.230
SURMA: Exactly.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.813
JAKE: Hang on.

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:08.960
And you would load
a spinner this way.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.085
What are you going to
display while that's loading?

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:11.840
SURMA: [GASPING]

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.080
JAKE: OK.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.010
So maybe not spinners.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.590
SURMA: Maybe not.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.090
JAKE: OK.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.341
But, like, deferred roots or--

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.173
SURMA: Oh, yeah, or
whatever kind of modules

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:18.180
you want later on.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.500
A view that is not-- you don't
need yet and later on you

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.150
need, then you can
load it on demand.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.060
And that's where you have now a
dynamic import little function

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.800
that works the same
inside of import,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.060
but it's something
that you can call

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.185
in the middle of your code.

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:31.240
It returns a promise.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.980
JAKE: Aha.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.480
OK.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.427
And then it resolves with--

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.510
what does it resolve with?

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.090
SURMA: With the module
exports and a special named

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.040
called default, which
is the default export.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.790
JAKE: Export.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.450
Excellent.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.050
OK.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.150
So this is all of those
hacks we currently use

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.509
to load JavaScript dynamically.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.550
SURMA: Will just go away.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.640
JAKE: (WHISPERING) They go away.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.848
SURMA: And here's a fun fact.

00:01:48.848 --> 00:01:49.880
It's not a function.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.046
JAKE: Why is not a function?

00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:52.529
SURMA: Because it's syntax.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:53.820
JAKE: That's not a good reason.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.380
That's just a word.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.881
SURMA: No.

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.630
I actually don't know
the exact reasoning.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.220
But I think they had it as
a syntax and not a function.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.440
So you can't hack it.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.604
You can't overload it and
hook your own functions.

00:02:02.604 --> 00:02:04.895
It's supposed to be like a
security mechanism, I think.

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:05.180
JAKE: OK.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.097
SURMA: But it's just an
interesting, fun fact

00:02:07.097 --> 00:02:08.930
on the side that really
shouldn't affect you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.664
in your daily life as
a developer at all.

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:11.330
JAKE: Excellent.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.450
So can I use this in regular
JavaScript or just modules?

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.720
SURMA: Just modules
because it is a module.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.880
JAKE: That does make sense.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.000
SURMA: But you can just
use script type module.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.157
And then you have a module.

00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:22.490
And you can use dynamic imports.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.110
JAKE: And all those
hacks just go away?

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.485
SURMA: It's going
to be a great--

00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:26.530
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.312
JAKE: You're out of time.

00:02:28.312 --> 00:02:30.603
SURMA: The last time I think
there was 40 seconds left.

00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:32.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.090
JAKE: Transform streams?

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.700
SURMA: Transform streams is--

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.890
we have readable stream
and writable stream.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:39.580
JAKE: Yes.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.330
SURMA: What is it?

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.920
Transform stream?
