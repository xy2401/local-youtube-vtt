00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.020
SPEAKER 1: Something
that I noticed

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.197
had just popped into canary--

00:00:05.197 --> 00:00:06.780
I kind of knew there
was plans for it,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.610
but I didn't realize
how far along it was,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.710
and now it's in canary--

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.789
is Event Target.

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.080
SPEAKER 2: That's been a thing.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.455
SPEAKER 1: That
has been a thing.

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:18.722
So Event Target is the
thing that gives us ad--

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:20.930
SPEAKER 2: It's a horrible
name, by the way, I think.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.080
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.870
SPEAKER 2: Because,
like, the thing makes--

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.940
Event Target makes a thing--

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.320
something that can emit events.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.070
SPEAKER 1: Well, Node calls
it EventEmitter, which

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.540
is a better name, I agree.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.730
But Event Target has
been with us for,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.230
like, many, many years and--

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.740
SPEAKER 2: As all the things
on the web that are ill-named

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.260
usually are.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.680
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.763
So we can't change it now.

00:00:41.763 --> 00:00:45.160
But that's-- like, everything
that has addEventListener

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.730
inherits from Event Target.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.920
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.586
And the thing is,
it's usually something

00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:50.910
that you only see in the specs.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.240
You see, like, this new thing,
it implements Event Target.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.104
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:00:55.104 --> 00:00:56.520
SPEAKER 2: But
it's not actually--

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.150
SPEAKER 1: It extends.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.191
SPEAKER 2: Or it extends.

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:01.260
But it actually cannot
extend it in your code.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.100
BOTH: Until now.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.950
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:10.650
SPEAKER 1: Finally.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.691
Like, because if you've
done anything with Events

00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:16.260
before, that you've wanted
your own pub/sub or something

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.360
kind of system, you
end up thinking,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.784
well, I'll get a library or
write my own or something.

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:21.450
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.325
Like usually, you end
up with horrible hacks.

00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:26.094
And I was one of these people
who wrote horrible hacks.

00:01:26.094 --> 00:01:26.760
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.260
Exactly.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.980
Just to repeat something
that's already on the platform.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.760
It's a total violation
of the extensible web.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.170
And so people--

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.722
I think it was Domenic
Denicola-- have

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.180
got together and
actually inspected

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.300
what the constructor looks like
and how you would extend it,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.440
and how you'd use it.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.164
And it's now in canary.

00:01:45.164 --> 00:01:46.330
You can do New Event Target.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.496
SPEAKER 2: Oh, it's so good.

00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:50.680
SPEAKER 1: You can do class
whatever extends event target.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.740
And now you have
addEventListener.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.584
Now you have dispatchEvents.

00:01:54.584 --> 00:01:55.500
You've got the whole--

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.090
SPEAKER 2: Which are the
only two things you need.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.173
SPEAKER 1: Right, exactly.

00:01:58.173 --> 00:01:59.460
Well, and this is the thing.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.350
There's this long-term
plan that, at some point,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.635
we'll replace addEventListener.

00:02:04.635 --> 00:02:05.510
Well, not replace it.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.710
We'll enhance it
with observables.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.400
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.520
I've seen the--

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.170
I'm going to call
it a scratch pad

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.105
because it's probably too early
to call that an even explainer.

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:16.896
SPEAKER 1: Well, there's
been loads, right?

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:18.450
There's been loads of little--

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.130
yeah, loads of little
ideas around this.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.397
But the kind of--

00:02:21.397 --> 00:02:23.730
the central agreement is that
this should be how we do--

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.729
SPEAKER 2: Things that
can do events should also

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.830
be able to do observables,
which is a stream of events.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.102
But be careful with that.

00:02:30.102 --> 00:02:30.810
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.410
Yes.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.300
But this means that you can--

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.160
if everyone starts
using Event Target now,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.290
once we get the support
across the board,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.749
it means when
observables do land--

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:40.248
SPEAKER 2: Support
across the board.

00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:41.830
SPEAKER 1: Support
across the board.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.040
That's a good catchphrase.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.830
Is that another
jingle that we need?

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.030
SPEAKER 2: Maybe.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.060
SPEAKER 1: Probably not.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.272
Yeah, but then when
observables land,

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:53.730
you'll get those
for free, as well.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.500
SPEAKER 2: That would
be really, really good.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.870
SPEAKER 1: It's one of those
things that kind of seems--

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.620
SPEAKER 2: Well, the
thing is I'm not sure

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.170
if the people listening slash
watching are necessarily

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.460
aware of what you have to do.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.620
Because the only things
that Extended Event Target

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.080
were tangible for you
were DOM elements.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.350
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.486
SPEAKER 2: Or message boards.

00:03:16.486 --> 00:03:17.110
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.940
SPEAKER 2: As far as I know.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.356
SPEAKER 1: There's
lots of-- well,

00:03:19.356 --> 00:03:21.930
things like
navigator.serviceworker

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.460
extends Event Target.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.510
There's lots of stuff.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.100
Yeah.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.190
SPEAKER 2: So for
example, the thing--

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.772
I basically wrote
a little tweet.

00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:29.730
I was like, oh, look,
here is a nice way we can

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.896
build your own Event Target.

00:03:30.896 --> 00:03:34.050
I would legit just create a
message ship port-- message

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.250
channel-- which is a message
board, rip out one port,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.650
and it would have Dispatch
Event and Add Event Listener.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.390
And I will just bind these
functions to my own optic.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.782
And suddenly, my optic
would be kind of like--

00:03:44.782 --> 00:03:45.490
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.990
That's a nice hack, just
built around a very small--

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.870
SPEAKER 2: But
it's still a hack.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.520
For example,
event.target was always

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.860
going to be wrong because it
would be the message boards

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.825
of the actual object I used.

00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:56.520
SPEAKER 1: And "this"
in the function

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.660
would be wrong for
the same reason

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.140
because that's the Event Target.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.420
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, unless
you bound to this

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.450
and your functions are--

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.650
SPEAKER 1: Oh, yeah.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.630
SPEAKER 2: It's just--

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.950
and then Remove Event
Listener wouldn't work again.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.450
You know?

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.190
SPEAKER 1: Unless you
patch that through.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.570
Yeah.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.990
OK.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.960
SPEAKER 2: It was just horrible.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.630
And people were using
it anyway because there

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.463
was no other choice.

00:04:10.463 --> 00:04:14.871
And so it's so good that they
finally came up with something

00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:15.920
like this.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.459
Yes.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.630
SPEAKER 1: It's just
another thing in the browser

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.000
that's exposed to developers,
as it should have always been.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.930

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.500
It works.
