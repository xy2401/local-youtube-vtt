SURMA: We are getting
bombarded with tree stuff now.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:02.557
JAKE: Yeah.

00:00:02.557 --> 00:00:02.940
I'll be on it.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.270
I'm on it.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:03.770
That's going to be my--

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.090
SURMA: It's just, like, doing
the picking the entire time.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.440
JAKE: Boo, boo, bep,
boop, boop, beep, boop.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.109
DARIN FISHER: I'm back--

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:08.609
camouflage.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:09.266
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.265
SURMA: You're just blending
into the background.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:13.636
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, blending
in with the tree stuff.

00:00:13.636 --> 00:00:16.594
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.020
SURMA: Who are you, and why?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.210
DARIN FISHER: Who am I?

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.440
I am Darin Fisher.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.560
I work on Chrome.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.185
SURMA: Welcome.

00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:27.559
DARIN FISHER:
Chrome Engineering.

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.840
JAKE: So you were there
right at the start of Chrome.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.125
DARIN FISHER: Yes.

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:30.410
Yes.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.610
JAKE: Right?

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.190
You've been--

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.860
DARIN FISHER: Middle of
2006, we got started coding.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.810
SURMA: So-- wait, 2006?

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.771
DARIN FISHER: 2006.

00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:37.270
JAKE: Oh.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.120
DARIN FISHER: Chrome launched
in 2008, but we started in 2006.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.570
SURMA: Oh, the launch.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.370
Because I was
like, wait, wait, I

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.525
hope you're talking about
the 10-year anniversary.

00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:42.660
Like, it's 12 years now.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.757
DARIN FISHER: Yeah.

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:44.570
That's why I tell
people, like, 10 years?

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.890
It's been 12.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.870
JAKE: It takes two years
to build a browser?

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.770
DARIN FISHER: It took two
years to build a browser.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.895
Now, mind you, that's
without the rendering engine.

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:52.875
We just used WebKit.

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:54.410
SURMA: We were
WebKit-based, yeah.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.650
That already existed.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.800
DARIN FISHER: And when
I say we didn't have,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.600
in the beginning, a team that
could go and build a rendering

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.950
engine like that, so--

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.150
SURMA: I mean, that's an
undertaking, isn't it?

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.840
JAKE: Yeah.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.580
SURMA: How many people
were there at the start?

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.780
DARIN FISHER: Well,
we were actually--

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.405
you have to go back-- rewind the
clock a little bit, because we

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:10.850
were a team at Google
working on Firefox.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.220
And the whole idea--

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.220
SURMA: That's a sentence
I didn't expect.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.011
DARIN FISHER: Yeah.

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.730
So for about a year and a half.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.980
I joined Google beginning
of January 2005.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.230
So we had a little, small
team bootstrapped out

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.260
of Google Security
to invest in making

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.700
web browsers work better.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.450
Google's business depends a
lot on the web, obviously.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.767
And the idea of actually
investing in Firefox

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:37.225
seemed like a really great way
to make the web work better.

00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:37.724
JAKE: Yeah.

00:01:37.724 --> 00:01:38.330
SURMA: OK.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.830
So quick, quick
question in between.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.990
You said you started in 2005.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.600
Do you remember your
interview question?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.890
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, totally.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.475
I interviewed with
the Gmail team.

00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:49.600
Do you really want to know
the interview questions?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.880
SURMA: Yeah.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.530
JAKE: Yeah, yeah, that's--

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.040
SURMA: I'm curious, now.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.130
DARIN FISHER: Oh, my goodness.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.546
JAKE: We're not
going to try them.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:54.297
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:55.630
SURMA: We want to keep our jobs.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.930
But--

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.450
JAKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.158
DARIN FISHER: OK.

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:59.800
So some of these are banned
questions now in the Google--

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.075
SURMA: Oh, that's good.

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:00.700
So then-- yeah.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.520
DARIN FISHER: --Google
interviews slate,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.830
because they get asked
so many darn times.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.205
JAKE: Right.

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:05.621
DARIN FISHER: But
there was things

00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:09.560
like draw a line on a
monochromatic bitmap.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.380
So imagine you have a monochrome
bitmap, so ones and zeros,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.750
and draw the line on that.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.961
So it's getting you to
do makeshift operators.

00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:18.803
JAKE: Oh!

00:02:18.803 --> 00:02:20.116
DARIN FISHER: Yeah.

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:23.030
I had another
question, which was,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.000
of a given array of integers,
find the max and min

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.010
values in that array,
or something like this.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.950
And so they just have you
pretty much write a brute force

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.742
algorithm for that.

00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:36.491
And then they ask if
you can do it faster,

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:39.020
and you're like, wait, but I
gave you-- that was so simple.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.130
Why-- how is there a faster way?

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.713
SURMA: Why would
you make it harder?

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:42.347
JAKE: Yeah.

00:02:42.347 --> 00:02:44.180
See, when-- if they
asked me, you know what,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.014
can you do it faster, I think
I would have deleted the code

00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:48.680
and then just typed
the same code again,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.275
but really gone for the typing,
especially because I knew it

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:51.775
now.

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:54.274
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, that would
have been a misinterpretation

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:55.080
of the question.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.670
JAKE: But, you know.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.878
SURMA: Thinking outside of
the box is what I call it.

00:02:57.878 --> 00:02:58.461
JAKE: Yeah.

00:02:58.461 --> 00:02:58.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.376
And for some reason,
when you said

00:03:00.376 --> 00:03:02.127
"a line on a
monochromatic bitmap--"

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:03.710
I've got a very
visual memory, so when

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.510
you said there's a
monochromatic bitmap,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.910
I imagined a sheet
of paper stuck

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.510
to the wall with a black
and white picture on,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.010
and they said, you've
got to draw a line on it.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.620
And I-- swoop.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.510
DARIN FISHER: Give
me the magic marker.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.270
JAKE: Can I-- do I get the job?

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.160
SURMA: That's why
you're in Dev Rel.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.660
JAKE: Yeah.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.310
[LAUGHS] Absolutely.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.560
I've been here while products
and stuff have launched,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.595
and there's a period
of trying to figure out

00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:25.220
the name of the thing
you're launching.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.750
There's always code names.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.790
What other things could
Chrome have been called?

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.748
DARIN FISHER: Oh, yeah.

00:03:29.748 --> 00:03:31.780
So the code base was
originally called Goose.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.790
SURMA: Wait, that-- I
did not see that coming.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.956
DARIN FISHER: That was the--

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:39.860
in the internal repository,
originally called Goose just

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.639
because.

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:41.680
Somebody came up with it.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.420
It was random.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.210
So when you ask engineers
to name things--

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.570
SURMA: Somebody had to
create a repository.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.251
DARIN FISHER: --you
get random names.

00:03:46.251 --> 00:03:47.750
So then we asked
the team to come up

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.504
with a good name
for the project,

00:03:49.504 --> 00:03:51.920
and they came up with a whole
bunch of other random names.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.310
JAKE: Anything stuck out?

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.851
DARIN FISHER: And
I think in general,

00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:56.960
the engineers didn't necessarily
take the process very

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.460
seriously--

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.774
--so a lot of names
that were pretty silly.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:02.955
JAKE: Well, because Chrome--

00:04:02.955 --> 00:04:04.580
DARIN FISHER: And
then, yes, then our--

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.663
SURMA: Like, even Chrome--

00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:07.324
DARIN FISHER: Our engineering--

00:04:07.324 --> 00:04:09.240
I think it was our
engineering manager came up

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.610
with the idea of Chrome.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.080
And he said, you know what,
let's just call it Chrome.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.150
Forget all those names
you guys came up with.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.730
SURMA: Because I mean, in the
end, the Chrome is what you--

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.545
in that day, was
just called the--

00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:21.170
JAKE: Yeah, that's what Firefox
called the rest of the browser,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.620
right?

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.370
DARIN FISHER: The
chrome of an application

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.910
is the UI around the
content area, right?

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.630
SURMA: Yeah, the
window border kind of--

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.213
DARIN FISHER: Yeah,
the window border.

00:04:28.213 --> 00:04:31.580
In fact-- yeah, absolutely,
in Firefox, chrome

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.850
refers to that part of
the browser, all the XUL

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.990
parts of the UI.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.246
And I mentioned XUL.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:40.870
If I need to explain
that, let me know.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.578
SURMA: XULRunner.

00:04:41.578 --> 00:04:42.260
I remember.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.010
DARIN FISHER: Yes.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.440
Well, anyways, so in Chrome--

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.870
in WebKit even,
there's APIs that

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.520
refer to informing the chrome
of the browser about state

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.480
changes.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.340
And so we just called
the browser Chrome.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.757
It was almost like
a joke kind of.

00:04:56.757 --> 00:04:58.048
SURMA: It's almost a pun, yeah.

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:00.140
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, and
then so we didn't actually

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.010
expect that to be the
name of the product.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.100
JAKE: The joke's
gone too far now.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.320
DARIN FISHER: Yeah.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.210
JAKE: Here we are.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.880
SURMA: Here we are
10 years later.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.475
DARIN FISHER: At
some point, they

00:05:05.475 --> 00:05:07.516
were like, hm, if we put
"Google" in front of it,

00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:09.290
could that just be
the product name?

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.940
Let's see if we
can get that past--

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.980
SURMA: I would have loved
to see that with Goose.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.771
DARIN FISHER: --through
the naming process.

00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:17.450
The idea of Chrome also kind
of evolved into this emphasis

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.140
on content, not chrome.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.250
So this idea, this guiding
principle of we're here

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.090
to build a browser that's--

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.720
the users care about the content
that they're engaging with,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.485
not about using the browser.

00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:30.110
And so if you think
about it, we wanted

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.610
to have this-- that
sort of informed

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.630
a minimalistic approach
to the browser UI.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.150
JAKE: Hm.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.620
SURMA: So we don't want to
go back to the times in IE

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.890
where you had, like, 18
different search bars.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.056
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:40.580
SURMA: Yeah, those
were good times.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.050
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.620
So it minimized the chrome.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.650
It's called Chrome, but
it minimized the chrome.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.530
JAKE: So are we
going to keep working

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.667
on Chrome for, like, 40 years?

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:52.250
I'm trying to figure
out if I can just

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.410
ride this job to retirement--

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.000
DARIN FISHER: Yeah,
I think you will.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.650
JAKE: --or whether I need
to start making plans.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.580
DARIN FISHER: I think that's
a good choice, good career

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.860
choice.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.870
JAKE: Yeah, the web's
going to be around?

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.170
We're going to be OK?

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.980
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, the web's
been around for a long time.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.530
It's going to continue to
be around for a long time.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.280
The fundamental
concepts of the web--

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.670
an open platform where
anybody can publish content,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.510
and others can come along and
bring that content to users

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.950
through different form factors--

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.630
it's actually remarkable, right?

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.257
SURMA: It is.

00:06:15.257 --> 00:06:17.840
DARIN FISHER: And I think that's
the-- adds an amazing staying

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.320
power.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.760
SURMA: And the stuff from
the '90s still works.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.551
I mean, the canonical
example at this point

00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:24.500
is Space Jam, which people still
love to open up, apparently.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.830
JAKE: The first ever website--

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.270
that still works as well.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.505
That wasn't Space Jam.

00:06:28.505 --> 00:06:29.720
SURMA: No, that was--

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.262
very close.

00:06:30.262 --> 00:06:31.970
DARIN FISHER: But it's
interesting to see

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.110
how the web evolved from a
world with desktop computing

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.666
to mobile computing, and now--

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:39.290
SURMA: Watches.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.850
DARIN FISHER: Yeah,
watches, VR, AR--

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.550
SURMA: Everything.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.133
DARIN FISHER: --and so on and
so forth as form factors change.

00:06:44.133 --> 00:06:47.660
That fundamental principle of
an open way in which people

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.490
can publish content
and then others

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.970
can figure out how to bring that
content to users in new form

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.370
factors is there.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.940
There's an opportunity
to create it.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.180
JAKE: It feels like a
lot of different systems

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.242
have promised that
multi-platform, running

00:07:02.242 --> 00:07:04.700
everywhere thing, but it feels
like the web's the first one

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.785
that's really actually worked.

00:07:05.785 --> 00:07:06.830
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, it's
kind of there by default.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.600
JAKE: Yeah.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.300
SURMA: So with Chrome
being around for

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.342
the foreseeable future, what is
the thing you look forward to

00:07:14.342 --> 00:07:15.550
in the near future of Chrome?

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.990
What are the next upcoming
things that you think,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.955
that's a big one?

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:20.480
DARIN FISHER: Oh, well,
I mean, there's just so

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.470
many things we're working on.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:21.750
SURMA: There is, right?

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.580
DARIN FISHER: Yeah.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.220
I mean, I'm really excited--

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.860
JAKE: Pick a favorite.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.984
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, I know.

00:07:24.984 --> 00:07:25.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.798
JAKE: Which of your
children are your favorite?

00:07:27.798 --> 00:07:31.850
DARIN FISHER: I'm pretty jazzed
about the future with thinking

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.670
about WebAssembly, for example,
and the opportunity that

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.590
creates for
developers, especially

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.130
folks who have their roots in--

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.222
or they have a bunch
of C code that they

00:07:42.222 --> 00:07:44.180
wish they could bring to
users through the web.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.790
SURMA: Tapping into this
existing ecosystem of C

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.390
has been around for
years, and it's not

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.350
been usable on the web.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.520
And suddenly, just, it is.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.160
DARIN FISHER: And I was really
excited to see what the work

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.480
AutoDesk did to bring AutoCAD
to the web through WebAssembly.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.610
I think it's really exciting,
because there's just actually

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.610
not only a lot of
code written that way,

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.318
but also a lot of
developers who know how

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.880
to create cool things this way.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.330
And I think it just creates
a lot more opportunity.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.455
SURMA: We're going to link
to the WebAssembly talk,

00:08:12.455 --> 00:08:14.814
because they have AutoCAD's
presenting what they did,

00:08:14.814 --> 00:08:15.980
which is absolutely amazing.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.940
So that's going
to be really cool.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.440
DARIN FISHER: And
I think, actually,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.100
the thing that's amazing is they
made previous attempts to bring

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.106
some of their
applications to the web,

00:08:25.106 --> 00:08:26.480
but it was only
until WebAssembly

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.160
that it was actually
possible for them

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.039
to do it in a reasonable
fashion and get a good result.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.580
JAKE: Something I wanted to
build for years was an image

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.500
compressor on the web,
something that brings

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.909
all the existing codecs in.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:41.690
And it's something I
tried five years ago, when

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.609
ASM was a thing, but
couldn't quite get there.

00:08:43.609 --> 00:08:45.650
Some of the memory management
stuff wasn't there.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.275
DARIN FISHER: I think
it doesn't really

00:08:47.275 --> 00:08:50.660
scale to say the browser has
to bake in APIs for everything

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.130
you could possibly want to do.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.540
Rather, to give the right
low-level primitives,

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.790
so that developers can build
not just great applications,

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.400
but also frameworks that
allow others to build great

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.670
applications and for people
to be able to innovate on that

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.700
foundation, either
that means we have to--

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.150
we can't possibly think
about all the stuff

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.608
that people are
going to do, but we

00:09:09.608 --> 00:09:11.960
have to build a platform that
creates more freedom and--

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.130
SURMA: Things that
plug together.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:13.625
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:15.740
JAKE: Yeah, to be able
to build something

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.914
that can display and compress
WebP in Safari, a browser that

00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:21.080
doesn't support it natively.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.955
And now we can do it.

00:09:21.955 --> 00:09:23.163
That's something you've been-

00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:24.570
SURMA: [INAUDIBLE] Lego.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.650
JAKE: Yeah, something
you can put together.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.790
SURMA: Give the building blocks.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.020
JAKE: Yeah.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.000
DARIN FISHER: Give
the building blocks.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.410
Yeah.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.350
JAKE: When someone's
suggesting names for products,

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.330
and someone goes, no, we can't
have that, that's a silly name,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:32.910
I just--

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.120
I stop everyone and
say, we all work

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.655
at a company called Google.

00:09:36.655 --> 00:09:37.696
DARIN FISHER: Yes, right?

00:09:37.696 --> 00:09:40.240
JAKE: That might
seem normal now,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.680
but if you tell people about
that, it sounds ridiculous.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.230
DARIN FISHER: Yeah.
