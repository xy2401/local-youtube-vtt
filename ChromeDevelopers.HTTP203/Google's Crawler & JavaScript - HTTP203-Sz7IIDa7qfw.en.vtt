JAKE ARCHIBALD: Do we
do an interview now?

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.400
Is this how we--

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.358
MARTIN SPLITT: [LAUGHS]

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:05.310
SURMA: But we didn't--

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.560
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Look, all I
wanted to hear was please.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.830
Action!

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.640
SURMA: I know--

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.806
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So impolite.

00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:11.916
Oh my god.

00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:14.331
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.250
Who are you, and why?

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.250
MARTIN SPLITT: Why, I
still haven't figured out,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.650
but I'm Martin Splitt,
and I have recently

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.090
joined the ranks of DevRel
for Search and web ecosystem

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.590
at Google.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.090
SURMA: Ooh.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.590
MARTIN SPLITT: Mm.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.740
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So what are
you here to do at Google then?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.570
MARTIN SPLITT: Google Search
wants to basically get out

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.254
of your way.

00:00:33.254 --> 00:00:33.920
That's the idea.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.260
Like, you just do the
right thing for your users,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.437
and we do the heavy
lifting on the back end

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:39.270
to make that happen.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.103
SURMA: So is this
basically where, you know,

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:42.890
for the longest time
certain techniques

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.700
were a no-go for developers
because it would lower

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.700
your chance of getting
to the position in Search

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.720
where you wanted to end up?

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.960
MARTIN SPLITT: Well,
that's still a thing.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.610
You can still try
to game the system,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.030
and the game is going
to punish you for it.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.400
Like, we are pretty good
at catching these things.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.900
But nonetheless,
there are a few things

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.020
where we can improve
the way that we

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.330
help you get stuff on Search
and get like the relevant users

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.170
to your page.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.090
And there's a bunch
of best practices,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.490
and there's going to be talks
on I/O here from my coworkers

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.924
Maria and John--

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:19.090
John Miller and Maria Moeva.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.340
JAKE ARCHIBALD: All right.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.360
MARTIN SPLITT: And
they're going to tell

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.060
you more about how to make
JavaScript and Search better

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.930
friends.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.360
And in the background,
I'm basically

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.940
figuring out where JavaScript
and Search are not friends.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.060
SURMA: I guess we'll
link to those, maybe?

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.250
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes, we will.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.820
SURMA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.780
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So is
this about making things

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.137
like single page apps?

00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:34.970
MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.440
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.398
SURMA: And [INAUDIBLE]
biggest changes recently

00:01:37.398 --> 00:01:40.430
where now the crawler basically
is able to execute JavaScript,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.150
so single page apps suddenly
became a proper first class

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.234
citizen in search results.

00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:45.816
MARTIN SPLITT: But
then certain people

00:01:45.816 --> 00:01:47.240
figured out, like,
wait a minute.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.130
You say it executes JavaScript,
but what does that mean?

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.330
If my page takes 10 seconds
in executing JavaScript,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.520
is that fine?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.784
Or what if I do this--

00:01:55.784 --> 00:01:56.450
SURMA: It's not.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.658
MARTIN SPLITT: --interesting.

00:01:57.658 --> 00:01:58.520
It's never.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.470
That's never fine.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.860
That's never going to be.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.860
But there's a few things, and
we are running a certain Chrome

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.370
version.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.840
We have recently
published-- well, recently,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.298
I think like last
year we published

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:08.900
which Chrome version that is.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.720
We are a little--

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.390
JAKE ARCHIBALD: 40-something.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.556
MARTIN SPLITT: So yeah,
we're a little behind there.

00:02:13.556 --> 00:02:14.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.040
And we're working
on catching up.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.090
And for the time being, we
have to put out some guidelines

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.320
for people to fix the issues.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.310
And we're also getting into
how the frameworks are doing

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.110
certain things,
and if we can help

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.170
them do certain things better
or if they're doing things fine

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.930
already, so that
people get a better--

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.660
That's a pretty different
angle, because before, you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.000
were doing like VR, AR things.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.960
MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.505
SURMA: So that's like the
other end of the spectrum.

00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:43.880
MARTIN SPLITT:
That's pretty much

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.780
the other end of the spectrum.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.080
It's nonetheless super
exciting, because obviously you

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.670
want people to find your stuff.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.424
And it's cool if you
build VR things--

00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:51.590
SURMA: Who would've thought?

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.870
MARTIN SPLITT: Right, I know.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.090
And in the future,
hopefully not too far out,

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.860
we might actually
also have a look

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.165
at how we get like 3D content
into Search so that you can--

00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:02.540
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Oh, no, because I

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.310
hate looking for things
around the store.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.705
Is that what it's
going to be like?

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:06.960
Like, searching
on the internet is

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.400
going to be like walking
in there and it's like--

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.190
MARTIN SPLITT: No, no, no, no.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.565
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You have
to walk up to somebody

00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:10.110
and go, excuse me.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.020
SURMA: Here's aisle page
one, aisle page two.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.860
MARTIN SPLITT: That's
not what I mean.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.020
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm just
looking for some socks.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.570
MARTIN SPLITT: No.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.695
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Where is
this sock aisle in Google?

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:18.260
MARTIN SPLITT: But today,
if you search for a product,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.480
you might already
see like a price tag

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.700
and where you can buy it
and the little picture.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.560
But if the picture is
not really helpful,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.230
then it would be nice to just
be able to spin it around, no?

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.438
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That is true.

00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:29.336
That is true.

00:03:29.336 --> 00:03:30.620
SURMA: Boom.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.040
MARTIN SPLITT: I'm not saying
that's going to happen.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.206
I'm just saying that's
something that I, personally,

00:03:34.206 --> 00:03:35.210
would love to see.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.580
SURMA: You can already be
quoted out of context now.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.150
MARTIN SPLITT: Amazing.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.566
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We can do that
with CSS 3D already, right?

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:41.782
You can just spin it around.

00:03:41.782 --> 00:03:43.990
It's the same thing on the
other side, just reversed.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.520
Right.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.280
That would work for socks.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.550
MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.758
For socks that would be fine.

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:48.550
SURMA: [INAUDIBLE] not
help, but you know.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.810
MARTIN SPLITT: Or CDs,
like, a picture of the CD

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.270
is probably-- ah.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.060
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You're
going to have to explain

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.330
that for the younger viewers.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.710
MARTIN SPLITT: Oh right.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.760
Yeah.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.820
We used to store music so that
we can listen to it on the go

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.150
eventually, and it was like--

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.670
SURMA: Very compact.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.420
MARTIN SPLITT: --little disks.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.540
Yeah.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.880
SURMA: Ironically
called a compact disk.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.046
MARTIN SPLITT: Very compact.

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:08.060
The size, apparently,
is chosen so

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.490
that some like Beethoven
something something

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.165
symphony fits on it
right away, like Philips

00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:14.040
designed it that way.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Is that right?

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.320
MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.250
SURMA: Oh, is that
why it's-- what is it,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.720
64 minutes originally?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.339
MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.630
That's the reason why.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.850
SURMA: So it's one-- this
CD can hold one Beethoven.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.683
MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah.

00:04:23.683 --> 00:04:26.240
[LAUGHS] Like, 64.7 something.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.176
Like, it's ridiculous.

00:04:27.176 --> 00:04:28.300
But that's where it comes--

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.770
SURMA: So are you saying they
could have made it better

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.270
and just didn't because
it fits a Beethoven.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.600
It's good enough.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.820
MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.130
It's kind of like, that's fine.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.110
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
So if people are--

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.530
MARTIN SPLITT: It's
a good trade-off.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.071
JAKE ARCHIBALD: If
people are wanting

00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:40.550
to do better at search on
the web, what's step one?

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.400
Is it to tweet you
and ask nicely,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.304
and you can go and press
the buttons and the thing

00:04:46.304 --> 00:04:46.970
goes to the top?

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.040
MARTIN SPLITT: No, none of us
can do that, and none of us

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.610
will do that.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.022
We also don't offer any
preferential supports.

00:04:52.022 --> 00:04:53.480
So even if you're
a partner, you're

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.771
not getting anything that
other people are not getting.

00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:57.650
So the best thing is
build it for your users.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.441
Use the tools that we
are putting out there

00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:01.240
like Lighthouse,
PageSpeed Insights.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.350
There's the mobile-first
testing tool, which

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.610
gives you a bunch of insights.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.740
Search Console is
a thing that you

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.842
can verify for your own page.

00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:10.550
And then you get a
lot of insights on how

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.600
you're doing in Search as well.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.930
And you can see how
Google is rendering it.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.263
SURMA: We give feedback on that?

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:15.120
MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.786
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
this is kind of a way

00:05:16.786 --> 00:05:19.170
to see how the Google crawler
sees your sight, right?

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.170
MARTIN SPLITT: Yes, yes.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.420
It's called Fetch as Google.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.260
It's probably going to be
called something else soonish,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.580
because we're working on a new
version of the Search Console.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.230
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We
like to rename things--

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.210
SURMA: #branding.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.180
MARTIN SPLITT: #branding, yeah.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.900
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, make
it difficult for people

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.040
to find, perfect.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.780
Excellent.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.280
OK.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.460
MARTIN SPLITT: Especially
in the Search Console

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.830
things like finding things
that are important, right?

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.490
No but the mobile-first
testing tool,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.710
that gives you also a view
of how Google sees your page

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.570
and shows you JavaScript
errors and stuff.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.687
It's pretty cool actually.

00:05:44.687 --> 00:05:45.770
SURMA: That seems helpful.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.720
MARTIN SPLITT:
Yeah, that's useful.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.460
Because forehanded--

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.030
SURMA: You said, the version
is a little bit further back,

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.197
so certain APIs might throw
or don't throw unstable.

00:05:51.197 --> 00:05:52.154
MARTIN SPLITT: Correct.

00:05:52.154 --> 00:05:53.950
And you basically,
beforehand, all

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.820
you had is you go Fetch as
Google, and it goes by page.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.570
Sorry.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.850
SURMA: Great.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.391
MARTIN SPLITT: And
then deal with it.

00:06:00.391 --> 00:06:00.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
what kind of cases--

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.330
where is that going to happen?

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.440
Is this like a case of
JavaScript errors or--

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.481
MARTIN SPLITT: Yes, in
case of Javascript errors,

00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:09.049
if you use features--

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:11.590
if your site breaks, if you use
certain features that are not

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.470
supported by the slightly
older version of Chrome

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.910
that runs the Google--

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.500
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Tiny little--

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.790
MARTIN SPLITT: Tiny little
bit of deviation from there.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.130
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
relatively not that old,

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.852
relative to the
age of the planet.

00:06:22.852 --> 00:06:24.310
MARTIN SPLITT: I
mean, the internet

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.470
is 25 years old or something.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.920
So it's like-- it's a glimpse.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.420
Nothing but a glimpse.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.700
So if you've got that
kind of JavaScript,

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.630
heavily Javascript-based
page, you're seeing errors.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.380
They're seeing just
like nothing coming up

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.612
in the Search Console.

00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:40.570
What's your next steps?

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.770
How are you going
to improve that?

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.330
SURMA: I mean, you would have
the errors on the console.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.980
MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah,
if there are errors,

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:44.920
then you'll find them.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.753
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:45.753 --> 00:06:47.751
SURMA: It's like now you
have actual features--

00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:49.750
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But what
if it's like, you know,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.820
core feature not
supported, go away.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.881
MARTIN SPLITT: Right.

00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:53.380
Then--

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.250
SURMA: Just [INAUDIBLE] it.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.208
[INAUDIBLE] everything.

00:06:55.208 --> 00:06:58.150
MARTIN SPLITT: So John talks
about that in his session.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.729
There's like
server-side rendering,

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.270
and there's something
that John likes

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.150
to call dynamic rendering,
where you render certain bits

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.000
and pieces and serve it
when you see the Googlebot.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.843
I know UA sniffing
is not a cool thing.

00:07:09.843 --> 00:07:10.810
But--

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.875
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh.

00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:15.304
That sounds like gaming
the search or something.

00:07:15.304 --> 00:07:16.220
You said that was bad.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.190
I'm going to have to
pull you up on that.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.100
MARTIN SPLITT: Here's the thing.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.110
You should not do it
to like trick users,

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.000
because we're going
to catch that.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.800
But if you serve
us an exact copy

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.254
of your content for the
Googlebot, then you'll be fine.

00:07:27.254 --> 00:07:28.920
You're not going to
be penalized for it.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.100
SURMA: But if it's an exact
copy, then what's the point?

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.220
MARTIN SPLITT: The point
being that you can layer

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.450
on additional functionality.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.300
Like if you give us a
static HTML version--

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.290
SURMA: I see, so with
[INAUDIBLE] rendering,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.480
basically.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.646
MARTIN SPLITT: Yes, exactly.

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:39.820
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.590
SURMA: On the Google version,
you don't inject with Java

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:41.950
and do magic stuff.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.074
MARTIN SPLITT: If you use--

00:07:43.074 --> 00:07:44.080
SURMA: Got it.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.746
MARTIN SPLITT: If you
use, I don't know,

00:07:45.746 --> 00:07:48.281
2019 JS, which is probably
going to be coming out very soon

00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:48.780
and--

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.720
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Probably next year.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.470
MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah,
right, I would guess.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.191
Or io18.js, which is
probably announced right now.

00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:58.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.922
Then you might run into
problems with Search.

00:08:00.922 --> 00:08:02.380
And then you can
go like, OK, but I

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.370
can have a server-side process,
render out to some HTML

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.739
so that we gets the
content of your document

00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:10.780
and the relations between
the different documents

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.000
that your application
consists of.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.720
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But that's good
for performance in general,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.220
right?

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.890
That's good for like
real users as well.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.090
MARTIN SPLITT: Yes.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.230
Which is why we
are fine with that.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.970
Because, again, we
don't try to build--

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.230
SURMA: It's a win-win.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.480
MARTIN SPLITT: --specifically.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.310
Yeah.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.950
We don't try to make you
something specific for search.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.626
What we want is to make your
website better for your users

00:08:27.626 --> 00:08:29.500
and make it relevant
and make it high quality

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.680
and make good content.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.618
And then it's our
task to get you found.

00:08:33.618 --> 00:08:35.409
SURMA: Are we going to
do interviews, mate?

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:36.880
We never have done
interviews on 203.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.230
We're suddenly starting
to do interviews now.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.980
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah,
well, it's going

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.270
to be awkward if
we don't interview

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.320
the person that is set.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.600
SURMA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.309
MARTIN SPLITT: No, it's fine.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:43.590
You know, I have
got a phone with me.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.320
It's over there.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.110
SURMA: You can just
browse the Instagrams.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.800
We just, you know, chat
about the usual stuff.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.758
MARTIN SPLITT: I'll make
this more interesting,

00:08:49.758 --> 00:08:51.240
like up the bet here.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.230
I'm going to use your
phone to [INAUDIBLE]..
