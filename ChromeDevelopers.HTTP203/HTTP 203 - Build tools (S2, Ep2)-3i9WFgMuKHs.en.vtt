00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.630
JAKE: I had this
experience at work once

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.710
where I was leaving work.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.070
I had my headphones in, I
was listening to some stuff.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.510
And I went to the bathroom.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.440
I went to the urinals,
because I needed to do a wee.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.940
And--

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.148
PAUL: Thanks for that update.

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:17.106
JAKE: And as it was
happening, I moved my hand,

00:00:17.106 --> 00:00:18.230
and I knocked my earphones.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.611
PAUL: No, no, no.

00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:20.110
JAKE: Yeah.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.360
You know what's coming, right?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.220
And it was just like this
slow motion of them falling.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.620
And there was peoples at
the urinals next to me,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.370
so I couldn't do
anything about it, right?

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.215
PAUL: You didn't knock it into--

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:31.759
JAKE: Well, no, no.

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.550
Well, if "Ghostbusters"
taught me anything,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.120
don't cross the streams,
right, is the key rule.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.480
No, I couldn't catch it.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.610
But once they landed in
there, they're ruined, right?

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.484
PAUL: Yes.

00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:44.400
You're not going to shove
those back in your--

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.665
JAKE: So I just carried on.

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:48.540
And it was just this
really depressing moment

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.540
where I just continued to
urinate on my earphones.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.135
PAUL: How is this
in any way related?

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:55.430
JAKE: Because that reminds
me of so many websites.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.054
I've been being
reminded of that moment

00:00:57.054 --> 00:00:58.570
when developing
so many websites.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.200
And it's because
if something like

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.199
that-- when you're
developing for i6, it's like,

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.120
why even try at that point?

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.980
It's already been pissed on.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.450
They're already ruined,
so why not just carry on?

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.299
Just to carry on.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.090
PAUL: Just make it.

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:22.501
JAKE: I still think the web
has the simplest Hello World,

00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:23.000
right?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.140
It's just doc type, Hello World,
and now you have a web page.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.065
It's all you need.

00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:30.580
PAUL: Or is it?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.080
No.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.840
JAKE: Yes it is.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.800
PAUL: No it's not.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.430
No, because we've made
it impossible, frankly.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.930
JAKE: We haven't
made it impossible.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.790
PAUL: Yes we have.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.560
To get going with the
web, first install NPM.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.120
Then probably install Bower.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.010
And then you install
Gulp or Grunt or both.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.290
And then download all
the modules you need.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.820
And then you wrap bizarre
things like [? Watcherify ?]

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.850
around Browserify
around BaileyFY.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.520
And then stand on one
leg, face due east

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.353
and then, and only then,
are you good enough

00:01:55.353 --> 00:01:56.529
to build for the web.

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:58.070
JAKE: What you're
talking about there

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.780
isn't building
something for the web,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.300
it's being excellence
to the web.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.320
It's making the web really good.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.880
And I know that's different.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.590
OK, go on.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.310
PAUL: Because no.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.800
Because every single
tutorial, when

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.270
you get past their little
world, it's going to say,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.202
in order to proceed, you're
going to require these tools.

00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:16.660
You're making it
sound like there's

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.580
a kind of on ramp,
where we gently go,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.350
I know you've got
this far with the web,

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.180
but now you need to just
ease across to these tools.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.070
Oh, and they're lovely
and easy to work with.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.570
No, no, no.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.500
We just go, to begin, first
to invent the universe.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.130
I do get it.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.670
And that like, I don't want
to say that the tools are bad,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.700
the tools the wrong.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.870
But I am concerned that the
next generation of developers

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.620
is going to get
somehow left behind.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.410
It feels like we're not taking
enough care over that journey

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.140
that people are going to
naturally have to go through.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.600
I saw this with Flash, actually.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.660
When ActionScript
got so advanced,

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.175
and the tooling got so advanced,
that it was just a brick wall.

00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:53.800
And one of the great
strengths of Flash

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.560
is that it had all these
designers coming in early on.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.919
People who were naturally,
sort of inclined to code.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.960
But they started to dabble,
and then the dabbling

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.812
became good and professional.

00:03:02.812 --> 00:03:04.270
And then before
you know it, you've

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.860
got these people who would
have never described themselves

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.604
as coders, doing
these amazing things.

00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:09.645
And they bring diversity.

00:03:09.645 --> 00:03:10.962
They bring interesting things.

00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:13.170
JAKE: This is not a new
problem with the web, though.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.760
You go onto Stack
Overflow, and you

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.230
find the question of how do
I hide an element on the web.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.680
And the answer is wow,
it's just a single line.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.109
And that single line uses--

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:22.650
PAUL: jQuery.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.390
JAKE: jQuery!

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.330
Absolutely, it does.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.150
And so we're just
kind of switching out

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.957
jQuery as a prerequisite
for something on NPM now.

00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:30.790
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.830
PAUL: No we're not.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.690
No, because with jQuery,
at least I can go there,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.480
and I can hit a big
download button.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.480
And I can get jQuery.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.160
I can include it with
a single line that

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.271
says source equals blah to
the jQuery, and then off I go.

00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:44.770
What we're talking
about is the fact

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.440
that you have to first of all
get all these command line

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.940
tools.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.220
And you have to go crazy
over this whole pipeline

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.170
before you even are able
to get to Hello World.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.720
We can't forget that
Hello World experience,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.160
because that's how
people get started.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.910
If not, we run the risk
of being-- essentially

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.560
making an SDK for the web.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.890
JAKE: I think you've forgotten
about the main problem

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.080
with this.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.680
And it's now like
if we want people

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.420
to be developing for the web,
one thing they have to learn

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.350
is Git.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.779
PAUL: I don't think that
Git is a big deal, actually.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:20.529
You don't have to.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.945
JAKE: Are you sure
you're not just

00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:24.270
forgetting how difficult
the learning curve was.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.680
PAUL: My Git workflow is
typically to type tower,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.963
hit Enter, and then use a GUI.

00:04:28.963 --> 00:04:31.710
JAKE: I still think
you need to understand

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.020
how version control works.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.395
Not just normal version control,
but Git version control,

00:04:35.395 --> 00:04:37.870
where it's all--
you can re-base.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.800
But even if you amend
the last commit,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.360
it's actually creating
a new commits,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.540
because are mutable things.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.360
People need to understand that,
just to start with the web.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.970
PAUL: [WHINE] They
don't have to.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.630
Again, you could
download jQuery.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.505
Just download, right?

00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:54.796
JAKE: And this is what we need.

00:04:54.796 --> 00:04:55.330
PAUL: Go on.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.560
JAKE: No.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.435
Exactly what you say.

00:04:56.435 --> 00:05:02.260
Is when someone has a Git repo
with a library or something,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.510
there must be a download link.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.980
Even it's just linking into
the source, a single source,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.200
or in a disk folder,
like a build version.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.330
There should be a click
there that someone

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.960
could copy and paste
that JavaScript

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.670
and now they're good.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.160
PAUL: Right,
because if you don't

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.951
want to go in for any
of this, and you just

00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:19.530
want to use this library,
there is a better way here.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.780
Where you can include in all
the workflow and do that.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.030
And it is a good thing and
a professional thing to do.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.590
If you just need it, go to the
disk folder, get the thing,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.240
use it, smile a happy
smile, and that's your day.
