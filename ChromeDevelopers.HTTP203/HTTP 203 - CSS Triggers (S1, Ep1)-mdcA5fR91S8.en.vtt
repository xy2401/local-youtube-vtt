00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.490
PAUL: My question
for you is how do you

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.070
know if changing a CSS
property is expensive?

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.155
JAKE: Like painting expensive?

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:18.030
PAUL: Not just paint.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.441
We're talking layouts,
we're talking paint,

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:21.440
we're talking composite.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.640
These things-- developers, they
talk about this all the time.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.007
How do I know if I'm
doing something that's

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.090
going to cause me a
bottleneck and it's a problem.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.040
How do you know?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.380
JAKE: It's normally just a
matter of do it and test it.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.172
PAUL: It was.

00:00:35.172 --> 00:00:36.630
It was, but it's
not anymore, Jake.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.380
Good news.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.220
I've made a website.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.171
CSStriggers.com

00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:39.670
JAKE: Yay!

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.550
PAUL: Woo!

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.875
CSStriggers.com

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:42.770
JAKE: CSStriggers.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.270
PAUL: Yes.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.780
Dot com.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.280
And it's a bit
pluggy, isn't it now?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.040
JAKE: This is not
like trigger warning?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.050
PAUL: Well, it could be,
depending on how upset

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.210
you get over CSS.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.662
JAKE: Yes, which can be
quite upsetting, especially

00:00:52.662 --> 00:00:54.120
if it's causing
performance issues.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.425
PAUL: Ah.

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:55.240
I like what you did.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.380
You brought it right back in.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.970
Yeah, anyway.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.370
So the idea is you hit the site.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.870
It's got all the
CSS properties, you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.210
can search for the one
you're interested in,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.501
and it will tell you whether
it triggers layout, paint,

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:05.890
composite, all of the above.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.810
JAKE: These are
different things.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.351
Are there things
that it would change

00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:09.960
that only affects
one of those things?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.460
Give me an example
of something that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.180
only affects painting,
but not the other things.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.347
PAUL: Painting, background
size, box shadow, text shadow.

00:01:18.347 --> 00:01:19.930
They do that because
they don't change

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.530
the layout of the
page in any way right?

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.980
They don't change the
geometry of the page.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.510
The widths, heights,
anything to do

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.940
with the element's actual sizes.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.630
JAKE: So there are
ones that do it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.470
the other way around as well?

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.610
PAUL: So it's more
like a waterfall.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.110
If you change layout,
which is going

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.635
to be changing the widths,
heights, basically the geometry

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:39.710
of the page, paddings, margins,
all that kind of stuff.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.520
You will change the
geometry of the page

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760
and that will dirty some pixels,
which will need to be repainted

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.597
and then you'll need
to composite the page.

00:01:45.597 --> 00:01:47.930
Or you change something which
causes the paint to happen

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.240
and you have to
composite the page,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.470
or you change
something which just

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.880
causes the page to recomposited.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.929
So it's a sort of
stepping process.

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.470
JAKE: When you
[INAUDIBLE] the state,

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.930
was this just from
memory and experience?

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.570
PAUL: Nope.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.550
I'm glad you asked.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.590
I made the mother
of all test suites.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.420
It was fantastic.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.670
And then I used telemetry
to kind of step through them

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.070
and figure out what was what.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.600
But I used will
change, which was

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.510
brand new and very exciting.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.170
Basically to say, I will
be changing opacity,

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.650
I will be changing box shadow.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.170
You tell me, when I do
this, what it triggered.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.660
And devtools just went, you
know what, I did a bit of layout

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.160
there.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.260
Did a bit of paint.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.684
Anyway, if you want to see how
your CSS affects performance,

00:02:28.684 --> 00:02:30.850
what work it's going to
trigger, just go to the site

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.610
and have a look.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.235
JAKE: Oh, cool.

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.264
And is that for every browser?

00:02:34.264 --> 00:02:35.680
PAUL: Other browsers
are incoming.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.220
Today it's only Chrome.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.720
JAKE: Cool.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.182
And what's the site name?

00:02:39.182 --> 00:02:40.640
I wasn't listening
to you properly.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.210
PAUL: Really?

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.910
JAKE: No, I really wasn't.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.850
You should say it again
just for my benefit.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.060
PAUL: Just your benefit?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.310
JAKE: Just my benefit.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.770
PAUL: Excellent.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.050
I'm glad we're having this
conversation, my friend.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.230
CSStriggers.com.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.730
JAKE: Yay!

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.229
PAUL: Woo!

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.180
JAKE: Keyboards.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.300
They're the computer
ones or the musical ones.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.550
You've used one before, right?

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.501
PAUL: No.

00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:01.000
Yes.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.500
JAKE: Yes.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.749
I've seen you in the office.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.790
Now, I imagine there was
a point where a keyboard

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.650
manufacturer thought, we
need to solve this problem.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.160
We need to give them a
key to press when they've

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.060
hit the wrong key and they want
to undo that error of theirs,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.920
right?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.810
And they called this
the backspace key.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.477
PAUL: Right.

00:03:19.477 --> 00:03:21.060
JAKE: So this key
that you're supposed

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.750
to press when you've gone off
by one, hit the wrong key,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.090
want to correct it.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.390
Where did they put this key?

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.690
PAUL: Right next to
the return/enter key.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.100
JAKE: Right next to the
key that says, no actually,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.560
everything is great, I
want to ship that text off

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.521
to a colleague.

00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:37.020
Right?

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.650
A colleague asked
for some help, and I

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.360
wrote, because I was a
little bit busy at the time,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.425
give me a sec.

00:03:43.425 --> 00:03:45.830
And I was like, oh
I've done it wrong.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.410
Went to press the backspace key.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.350
Enter.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.390
Off to the colleague.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.650
Off to their phone
goes, give me a sex.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.540
Like it was a demand.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.230
So I want to talk
about pointer events.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.780
PAUL: Yay!
