00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.409
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Merry Christmas!

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:10.908
Yay!

00:00:10.908 --> 00:00:14.510
It's the Christmas special, so
we've put on some Santa hats

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.922
and we've got some sleigh bells.

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.130
PAUL LEWIS: So I had an idea.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.150
Thought what we could do is
we could talk about 2014.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.840
what is your, what
is your highlight

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.802
what gets you yay
about 2014 web?

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:26.260
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I
thought we opened

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.020
strong by removing the 300
millisecond click delay.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.960
PAUL LEWIS: Did
that happen in 2014?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.830
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It
landed in stable in 2014,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.982
so it definitely counts.

00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:36.440
PAUL LEWIS: OK,
that's not a cheat,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.898
that's just a
bending of the rules.

00:00:37.898 --> 00:00:40.460
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, it's 2014
when it landed in stable.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.280
That's the rule.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.450
So rather than double
tap to zoom, if we know

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.780
it's a responsive
site, then we just

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.416
remove the 300
millisecond delay.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.790
It used to be that
you could only

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.740
do that if you disabled
pinch zooming, which

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.590
is-- we were punishing people
for making accessible sites

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.407
at that point.

00:00:57.407 --> 00:00:59.240
PAUL LEWIS: For me, web
components big deal.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.170
Obviously, first through
Polymer, but generally speaking

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.690
on the platform itself
you got Custom Elements,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.280
you got HTML Imports,
got Shadow Dom,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.110
you got really nice
ways for developers

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.890
to start encapsulating and
sending out their stuff.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.555
So I like web components
I think they're

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:16.380
a good move for the web.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.330
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's been a
good year for fonts as well.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.410
We've got the font loading API
which is-- it gives you events

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.510
when fonts load, which is handy
if you want to do something

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.880
different before the
fonts load in a document,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.034
but also excellent if
you're doing canvas work.

00:01:31.034 --> 00:01:32.200
PAUL LEWIS: OK, fair enough.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.620
Moving on, web animations.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.630
See, so we did--
In Chrome there's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080
a lot of re plumbing to
kind of put CSS transitions,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.220
and key frame animations through
the web animations back end.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.830
So all this stuff under
the hood got rewired,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.110
and now all the
web animations APIs

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.760
are starting to land on top.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.830
I think in the last week,
we got the ability to pause,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.600
and rewind, rescrub the--
slow the timing down,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.650
all that stuff.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.940
So that's amazing.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.160
And in dev tools,
it's not landed yet,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.421
but there is going to
be an animations control

00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:07.670
feature where you can scrub
animations back and forth,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.590
see which animations
are playing per element.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.840
You can see what the value
of all the animations are,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.070
so that's amazing.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.040
JAKE ARCHIBALD: In
terms of Evergreen,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.580
there's is a point
to be made there.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.547
We finally have it for--

00:02:18.547 --> 00:02:19.380
PAUL LEWIS: WebView.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.180
JAKE ARCHIBALD: The WebView.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.596
PAUL LEWIS: Yes
in Lollipop, we're

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:24.770
got the auto updating web
view, which is very exciting.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.039
All these new web features--
because developers,

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.580
like native app
developers, they seem

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.337
to use the WebView in places
where, well some people are

00:02:31.337 --> 00:02:33.920
going to use it for entire apps,
some people are using it just

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.490
for smaller parts of their apps.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.940
But they're getting the
latest and greatest.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.606
And that's actually
a really nice thing.

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:41.970
It just brings that web
magic, the Evergreen mindset,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.470
a little bit into
that native world.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.011
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
when we did that,

00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:47.269
I thought, about time
that that's updating.

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.560
PAUL LEWIS: I heard that
sentiment quite a lot as well,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.170
but you made a
really good point.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.655
We're the first people to do it.

00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:55.030
There's no other
platform that is

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.140
shipping an auto
updating WebView.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.322
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh that
open source success story

00:02:59.322 --> 00:03:00.780
of the earth-- the
picture element.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.446
PAUL LEWIS: Ahh.

00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:03.850
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You have ice.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.510
It is crowdfunding.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.730
PAUL LEWIS: The man's a hero.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.717
web, pretty pretty good.

00:03:09.717 --> 00:03:11.050
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Doing all right.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.560
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.210
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.960
PAUL LEWIS: 2015.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.835
JAKE ARCHIBALD: 2015.

00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:14.780
PAUL LEWIS: Get in.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think the most
important thing for 2015 is--

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.845
PAUL LEWIS: ServiceWorker.

00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:19.390
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
It's ServiceWorker

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.166
I'm glad you said that.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:23.290
PAUL LEWIS: One hit wonder.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.289
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's the
start of a massive land

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.120
grab into what is being
previously considered

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.880
native-only features.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.330
So I went onto the guiding
website a couple days ago.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.150
It had this banner that said,
download our app because you

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.230
get offline and alerts.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.740
I was looking at it going,
2015, the web gets that.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.790
PAUL LEWIS: That's great.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.194
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So exciting to
lookout for 2014 on the web.

00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:47.860
PAUL LEWIS: Yay.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.326
Cracker?

00:03:52.326 --> 00:03:53.200
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.920
PAUL LEWIS: Now, I
discovered that many folks

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.092
around the world don't
observe this tradition.

00:03:58.092 --> 00:03:59.800
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
a piece of cardboard

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.910
that makes a pop sound
when you pull it,

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.080
and inside there's a paper hat.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.362
Let's pull a cracker.

00:04:05.362 --> 00:04:06.445
PAUL LEWIS: Are you ready?

00:04:06.445 --> 00:04:07.460
Are you ready for this?

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.520
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So the
rule is that whoever gets,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.120
whoever ends up with most of the
cracker is the winner, right?

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.540
Is that the?

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.289
PAUL LEWIS: Yes, that's
fair, and then you

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:15.590
get the present inside of it.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.339
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Excellent.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.407
Yay, winner is me.

00:04:19.407 --> 00:04:21.990
I guess another part of the rule
is that British people thrive

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.770
on disappointment, and so the
thing you get inside a cracker

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.360
is part of that.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.037
So yes, a plastic
frog, excellent.

00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:32.370
That's something I will cherish
for the rest of my life.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.570
What other delights are in here?

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.830
The hat.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.310
PAUL LEWIS: It just screams
quality, doesn't it?

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.060
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well,
the other part of it

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.110
that you get the joke.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.902
PAUL LEWIS: These are
special web crackers.

00:04:43.902 --> 00:04:44.693
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh.

00:04:44.693 --> 00:04:46.760
PAUL LEWIS: So there may
be webby jokes inside.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK, here we go.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.100
How do ghosts find
things on the web?

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.630
They use Ghoul-gle.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.350
PAUL LEWIS: Wow.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.580
Classic this.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:09.990
Which HTML element did the
bride wear to her wedding day?

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.016
Address.

00:05:12.016 --> 00:05:13.790
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh,
the address element.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.700
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.090
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Why was
the accessibility tester

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.990
angry with the removal men?

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.245
Because they forgot
about the long desk.

00:05:26.754 --> 00:05:27.670
On the image element--

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.940
PAUL LEWIS: It's a
long description.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.732
Long desk, that hilarious.

00:05:33.732 --> 00:05:35.160
All right.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.460
Why did MVC framework blush?

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.349
Because it was Ember-arrassed.

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:43.640
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Ember-arrassed.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.170
PAUL LEWIS: It's
like embarrassed.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.840
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Brilliant.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.220
Why did Mr. Gyllenhaal not buy
John Rezig a Christmas card?

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.930
Because he makes jQuery.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.650
JQuery?

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.650
PAUL LEWIS: Jake weary.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.607
Oh, fantastic.

00:06:00.607 --> 00:06:02.440
It's a laugh a minute
around here, isn't it?

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.440
Yeah, Merry Christmas, ya f--
