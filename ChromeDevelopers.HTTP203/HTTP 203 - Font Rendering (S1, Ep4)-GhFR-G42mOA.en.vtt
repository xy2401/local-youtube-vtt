00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
JAKE: OK, Paul, I want to talk
to you about font rendering.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.582
PAUL: [SINGING] Ah!

00:00:03.582 --> 00:00:06.375
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.820
JAKE: So you visit a site.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.480
Everything downloads-- the
HTML, the CSS, the JavaScript,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.740
but not the font
for the content.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.216
What happens?

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:23.660
PAUL: You'd stare at a
white screen normally.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.920
JAKE: Well, it depends
on the browser, you see.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.850
So in Safari, for instance, it
will give you all the layout,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.464
everything, but it will
block rendering of that text.

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:34.380
PAUL: I thought it did
that in Chrome as well.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.900
JAKE: Chrome does
something similar.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.500
We used to do exactly that.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.400
But we took a cue
from Firefox, and we

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.639
decided we'll have
a 3-second timeout.

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:43.305
And then we'll render
the fallback font,

00:00:43.305 --> 00:00:46.181
and when the new font comes in,
we'll swap it to the new one.

00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:47.930
PAUL: I definitely
have two problems then.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.430
One--

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.420
JAKE: You have way
more than two problems,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.330
but I guess you're talking
about two specific problems.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.080
PAUL: To this, yeah.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.329
I mean, that's all the therapy
time we have for today.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.460
Hahaha, folks.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.880
Firstly, 3 seconds feels
really arbitrary to me.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.810
I'm not sure where
that comes from.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.210
JAKE: I trust they did research.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.950
PAUL: And then the
other thing about it

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.014
is switching fonts
really bothers me.

00:01:07.014 --> 00:01:09.430
Like if you're halfway through
reading a sentence and then

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.390
the font changes, it's got a
completely different metrics,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.389
then [POOF] what's that?

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:13.640
JAKE: Yeah, that's horrible.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.350
Words can swap from
one line to another.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.756
It's--

00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:16.255
PAUL: Ew!

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:17.020
JAKE: It's bad.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.730
So I think this is
part of the promise

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.470
is that there is
no one true answer.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.420
Like even what we do,
you know, what Firefox

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.300
is, what Opera does, it feels
like a compromise, which

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.560
is sometimes the worst
of all worlds, right?

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.050
We've got the delay.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.710
We also have to swap sometimes.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.300
PAUL: Yeah.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.850
OK, fair enough.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.350
JAKE: Thankfully, and the
new CSS property is arriving.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.520
Well, I say it's arriving.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.415
It is being proposed.

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:39.915
PAUL: OK.

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:41.348
JAKE: So it's a bit early
to say it's arriving.

00:01:41.348 --> 00:01:41.400
PAUL: Yeah.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.900
Wee!

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.032
JAKE: It's a proposal by
Kenji Baheux and Ilya Grigorik

00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:46.240
It's on GitHub at the moment.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.073
PAUL: Oh, those two.

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:49.240
JAKE: The worlds of
performance and funk combined.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.040
PAUL: [SINGING] Ah!

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.120
JAKE: But it's a CSS
property font rendering,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.510
and you get to pick
what strategy to use.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.782
Like how long do you
want to block for?

00:01:57.782 --> 00:01:58.615
Do you want to swap?

00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:02.680
Do you want to use a fallback
and then swap the new font in?

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.301
It also gives you the option
if you use another technique.

00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:08.009
And this is one that
we've seen pioneered

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.530
by-- I think it was "The
Guardian" that did it first.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.780
They use the font if they have
it, like if it's in the cache.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.410
If it's there, they'll use it.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.130
If it's not, they just
go for a fallback.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.182
They download the font,
but they don't swap.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:21.890
They download it.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.570
They put it in local
storage for next time.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.070
PAUL: OK.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.880
JAKE: But this is a
great example, I think,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.254
of the extensible web that
we've seen people do this.

00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:30.920
You've always seen
"The Guardian" do it,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.950
"Smashing" Magazine
do it now as well.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.840
And other people have-- you
know we've picked up on it

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.940
and think, well, let's
remove the bad bits.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.280
Let's avoid the amount
of code we need to write.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.430
Let's avoid the
local storage bit.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.865
Let's have a CSS
property for it.

00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:45.704
PAUL: Love it.

00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:49.092
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:53.760
JAKE: I've been at a few
conferences recently.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.910
PAUL: Yep.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.540
JAKE: And you know how
the conference after-party

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.050
is a great place for developers
to come together and chat

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.150
about things.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.986
So we'll put the
music really loud

00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:04.610
to really get the
conversation flowing.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.193
PAUL: Exactly.

00:03:05.193 --> 00:03:06.770
So nothing says
quality conversation

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.380
like shouting at another human
being from a couple of feet

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.900
away.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.400
JAKE: Right.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.230
So I was chatting
with this guy, and he

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.920
was giving me his
opinion on a thing.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.170
And as he was shouting, a bit
of spit came out of his mouth.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.260
PAUL: Oh.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.340
Where did it land?

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.330
JAKE: In my ear.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.210
It was a shot that
Luke Skywalker

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.420
would've been proud of.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.750
Like it just when [WHOOSH]
right in the hole.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.210
PAUL: Use the force,
Luke. [WHOOSH] [SPLAT] Ah!

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.670
JAKE: Yeah.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.794
And you know that if like
you get water in your ear

00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:35.340
then sounds sort of
[IMITATING SOUND UNDERWATER].

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.930
[LAUGHS]

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.330
There was so much spit in
my ear that that happened.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.830
PAUL: Go on.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.740
What was your exit
strategy for this, then?

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.380
JAKE: Well, no,
It was really just

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.690
to kind of politely
sort of go, no, yeah.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.075
Yeah, no, that makes sense.

00:03:47.075 --> 00:03:48.283
You should do some proposing.

00:03:48.283 --> 00:03:52.260
You should definitely
write that up.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.250
I'm just going to
the toilet now.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.670
I'll be back in a minute.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.474
And then a calm, collected walk.

00:03:58.474 --> 00:03:59.140
PAUL: Don't run.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.630
Don't run.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.860
Don't run.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.380
Don't run.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.760
Don't run.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.210
JAKE: Don't run.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.256
And then as soon as the
door opened, run to the sink

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:05.339
and like [AH] I've got to
get this out of my head!

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.146
PAUL: Hodge podge.

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:07.896
JAKE: It's a dangerous
world, conferences.

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:11.300
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.350
JAKE: Yes.
