00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.890
JAKE ARCHIBALD: This is
one of the things that's

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.870
changed on the web
since the start days

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.245
for me is you now need to set
up a server to do anything.

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:07.744
It used to be that you could
just run the stuff on your file

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:08.470
system.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.570
That doesn't work anymore
because the cross-origin rules

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.114
have been, quite rightly,
really tightened up in browsers.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.530
Like if you're on
the file system,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.480
you can't really
contact anything else.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.460
It's all treated as a
separate origin, which

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.501
it should be, right,
because you don't want a web

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:24.460
page on your machine being
able to go into your passwords

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.430
folder or whatever.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.061
But that's it.

00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:28.560
If you get started
with web, all you

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.170
need is an HTTP server running
on local host and off you go.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.840
PAUL LEWIS: No.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.340
No.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.200
Again, no.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.220
Always no with you.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.160
Right.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.660
Fine.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.244
It works on your
machine, and then you

00:00:37.244 --> 00:00:39.243
upload it to your server
and it goes, ha ha, no,

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:40.540
because it's no longer HTTPS.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.200
I've white listed local
hosts so you're good to go,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.330
but now, it should be Service
Worker, push notifications,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.720
all those lovely new
things you wanted, uh-uh.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.678
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Paul
hates security on the web.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.030
PAUL LEWIS: Again, HTTPS
is just too difficult

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.980
and there's so many features
being gated on HTTPS right

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.080
now that it's a bit depressing.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.209
You know, why?

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:11.000
Tell me the answer.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.760
JAKE ARCHIBALD: HTTPS
is super important.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.430
I think if there are two
sources of information that

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.750
are otherwise completely equal
and completely identical,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.900
except on one of
them, you can trust

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.290
that you'll receive
it unmodified,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.722
course that's better.

00:01:26.722 --> 00:01:28.930
PAUL LEWIS: I'm OK with it
from the user perspective.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.130
It's a good thing
to ship for users.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.572
But-- but-- it's not--

00:01:35.572 --> 00:01:36.530
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Button.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.050
PAUL LEWIS: Button.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.460
JAKE ARCHIBALD: He's going to
press the serious button now.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.870
This is your disapproval button.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.370
PAUL LEWIS: This is the--
aargh-- the rage button.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.520
Because the hosting
that you get is not

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.020
going to give you that by
default. It's too hard, right?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.360
If you go into DevOps and
you run your own server,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.540
you're by proxy saying,
this is something

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.060
I am willing to take on as
my responsibility, right?

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.450
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.100
PAUL LEWIS: OK?

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.782
But if you don't, and
the standard issue

00:01:57.782 --> 00:01:59.990
developer that I am, I don't
want to get into DevOps.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.460
I don't want to do that.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.330
I think the default option
from my host should be HTTPS.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.389
It shouldn't even
be a thing that I

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.956
have to opt into when
they go, you get PHP 4, 5,

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:12.330
MySQL, as many
[INAUDIBLE] as you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.870
want, oh, and you get SSL
just by default because you're

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.870
a human being who wanted
to get hosting from us.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I
think the big companies

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.871
such as Google, they
need to find a way to,

00:02:19.871 --> 00:02:22.350
rather than punishing
the developer,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.870
they punish the hosts.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.990
Because there's a lot of
hosts still using HTTPS

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.180
as a money spinner, whereas
with things like SNI,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.780
it can be super cheap.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.060
OK, with SNI, you
lose Android 2.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.380
Android 2 doesn't support it.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.070
And you also lose Internet
Explorer on XP, I think.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.880
But those things are going away.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.336
It should just be free, as
you say, with every host.

00:02:46.336 --> 00:02:47.960
PAUL LEWIS: HTTP at
this point, for me,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.260
should be more like a bug.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.750
It should be considered-- aah.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.420
That's--

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.520
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Now,
there's been some discussion

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.645
around that and there's
been some people suggesting

00:02:55.645 --> 00:02:58.120
that all new web
features should only

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.630
land on HTTPS, whether it's
security sensitive or not.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.850
I disagree with
that quite strongly.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.340
PAUL LEWIS: I think if 95% of
the web was HTTPS, fair enough,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.330
but it's not.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.940
I think we've got to get
more people as the default

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.220
before you start switching
things off properly.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.470
I can see the new features,
the ones that are security

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.910
sensitive particularly.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.820
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think
it's fine for security

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.510
sensitive stuff.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.260
Service Worker is HTTPS
only for a good reason.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.910
We tried to find a way to
make it work with HTTP.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.740
There wasn't a way.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.720
But for features
that don't need it,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.790
like we're getting
a new media API.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.437
So the Play, Pause keys on
your lock screen and stuff,

00:03:38.437 --> 00:03:40.020
we're going to bring
those to the web.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.021
That doesn't need HTTPS.

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:41.645
PAUL LEWIS: No.

00:03:41.645 --> 00:03:43.640
I mean, it would be
ludicrous if somebody said,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.350
WebGL or IndexDB,
they require HTTPS

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.950
because they're on the web.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.920
It doesn't make sense.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.420
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It
does sort of feel

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.670
like the standards people
wagging their fingers

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.324
at developers going,
eat your greens

00:03:55.324 --> 00:03:56.990
or you're not allowed
the pudding, where

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.269
the greens are HTTPS and the
pudding is new web features.

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.810
I don't think it's
a constructive way

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.400
to build up the web.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.450
