PAUL LEWIS: If you were born
at any other point in history,

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.884
you'd be completely stuffed.

00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:05.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm
full of [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.050
PAUL LEWIS: What
would you have done

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.372
if programming wasn't a thing?

00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:10.053
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Die in a ditch.

00:00:10.053 --> 00:00:10.915
I would.

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:11.780
I really would.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.080
PAUL LEWIS: It's a really
happy tale, isn't it?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.955
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:17.535
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.350
So I want to talk
about Pointer events.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.100
PAUL LEWIS: Right.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.070
So the CSS thing where you
say, Pointer events none.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.770
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
No, the other one.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.910
Because the other spec
that they made before,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.270
we're going to write a new spec.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.596
I know, let's name
exactly the same

00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:35.845
as an existing CSS properties.

00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:36.810
PAUL LEWIS: Yay.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.450
I'm talking about
the events one.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.750
PAUL LEWIS: Oh.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.166
Those, those are
brilliant, right?

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:44.740
Detailed spec, unifies touch,
mouse pointers, and gives you

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.580
all the everything
that you ever need

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.830
to just bring it all together.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.110
Brilliant.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.240
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's great.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.422
We're not doing it.

00:00:51.422 --> 00:00:52.130
PAUL LEWIS: What?

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.230
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We
do have good reasons.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.396
It's a really detailed spec.

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:57.030
It says the order of all,
how everything should happen.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.690
But there are
performance issues.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.175
It's very similar
to mouse events.

00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:04.174
You know when you move a
mouse across the screen

00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:08.570
and you get the mouse move
events and the target changes

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.425
after every element.

00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:10.192
PAUL LEWIS: Yup.

00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:12.400
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Pointer
events works in the same way.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.530
And that means that as
you're doing a touch action,

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.260
it's going to have to do this
hit test throughout the touch.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.010
PAUL LEWIS: Oh.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.770
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Big
performance problem.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.840
You could actually--
to be fair to them,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.230
you can set a capture on it.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.050
But then you've still got
the enter and leave events

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.300
on the element that
you've captured.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.880
That's a big performance no-no.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.440
And the unification stuff
that you mentioned--

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.330
PAUL LEWIS: Yay.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.110
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's not
as good as you think.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.570
PAUL LEWIS: Oh.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.250
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I
don't know about you,

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.069
but whenever I use touch
events, which we already have,

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.110
I usually use it because
I want something special

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.000
to happen with touch.

00:01:42.962 --> 00:01:43.670
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.150
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Like a
swipe action, or something

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.900
that I wouldn't want
to do with the mouse.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.740
PAUL LEWIS: Right.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.860
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And that's
what I find most of the time,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.620
that there are occasions, maybe
like a drag and drop action,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.240
where you'd want touch and
mouse doing the same thing.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.010
But mostly, not that.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.790
PAUL LEWIS: OK.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.300
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
And there are also

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.591
features that it stops as well.

00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:02.340
So pointer events, what
seems like another plus point

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.630
for them, is it's either
the user agent, the browser,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.956
dealing with the
touch stuff or you.

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:08.740
No in between.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.290
So if it starts scrolling,
you're out of the picture.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.940
But we have features
that need that.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.530
For instance, you're scrolling.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.410
You scroll to the top.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.554
And then you drag down.

00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:20.720
PAUL LEWIS: Pull to refresh?

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.360
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Pull to refresh.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.380
So that's you letting the
user agent do part of it.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.700
And then you want to
take over at that point.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.790
You can't do that
with pointer events.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.415
PAUL LEWIS: Oh.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:30.120
That's horrible.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.940
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.570
And it's just all of
these little things

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.611
that have got in the way.

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:38.270
But the main one is, we
already have touch events

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.450
in all the major
browsers except IE.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.910
And pointer events
are not good enough

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.832
to justify kind of
throwing that out,

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:49.290
because we would have to support
for ages for all the sites

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.950
anyway.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.040
And the good news as well
is Internet Explorer,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.319
they recognize that
touch is not going away

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.110
and they are going to
implement it as well.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.901
PAUL LEWIS: Hooray.

00:02:58.054 --> 00:03:01.942
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.100
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I wanted to get
something else off my chest.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.300
PAUL LEWIS: Oh, no.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.220
Not again.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I know.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.910
I know.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.940
And I want to talk
about getting undressed

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.454
because it's not something
I'm very good at.

00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:17.120
It's not something
I'm very graceful at.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.141
But we bonded over
something about this.

00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:23.140
PAUL LEWIS: Yes, we did.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.570
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And I wanted
it to go over it again,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.350
because the final
moment of undress, which

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.110
is when I've gone through the
clumsy uncool underwear down,

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.320
and then what happens.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.840
PAUL LEWIS: You absolutely have
to do a flick with your foot,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.712
whoop, catch, and then slam
dunk into the wash basket.

00:03:41.712 --> 00:03:43.420
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
then all of a sudden,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.570
all of the clumsiness--

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.990
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, it's
gone because you're

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.330
naked and cool at that point.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.600
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.580
You're the coolest naked
person in the room.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.530
Right.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.350
But I was at home doing clumsy
undress and then the recovery,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.124
whoosh, boom.

00:04:00.124 --> 00:04:01.560
And I thought of you.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.820
Paul.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.410
Naked Paul.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.725
How am I expected
to live my life?

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.220
PAUL LEWIS: Now, we get an
API, the web smoothness API.
