00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.067
FEMALE SPEAKER: Talk to me.

00:00:03.067 --> 00:00:03.650
PAUL: Talking.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.410
Sorry.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.218
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Yeah, that's better.

00:00:05.218 --> 00:00:06.430
I think it's just the cable.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.044
OK, cheers.

00:00:07.044 --> 00:00:08.210
PAUL: Bit of a Kurt Russell.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.080
He was in "Fast and Furious 7."

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.900
JAKE: Kurt Russell?

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.620
PAUL: He's in that,
and he's amazing.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.970
He's doing that Robert
Redford thing, where--

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.852
JAKE: I can't remember,
because you told me

00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:18.060
which "Fast and Furious" was.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.310
I can't remember
what it was like.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.910
PAUL: Right.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.159
The "Fast and Furious" thing--

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:23.310
JAKE: Divorced, beheaded--

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.470
PAUL: It's not all the different
wives of "Henry VIII," no.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.980
One, definitely.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.200
Two, but you ignore the
third, which is "Tokyo Drift."

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.320
So you just ignore
that for a second.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.890
Four, five, and then do three.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.920
But I should have said, the last
bit of five-- no, sorry, six.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.250
You do four, five, six--

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.140
JAKE: This is like trying to
understand the offside rule.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.431
PAUL: Just watch them in order.

00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:48.270
JAKE: I watch one-- watch
one and two, then one again--

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.702
PAUL: Four, five--

00:00:49.702 --> 00:00:51.826
JAKE: I watch three, but
with the subtitles of five

00:00:51.826 --> 00:00:53.970
over the top, and then
"Dark Side of the Moon"

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.580
playing in the background.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.650
PAUL: If I'm honest,
I don't think you're

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.380
taking this seriously, Jake.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.510
Anyway, let's talk
about something else.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.216
The web.

00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:01.498
JAKE: The web.

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:05.310
