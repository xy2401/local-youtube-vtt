JAKE ARCHIBALD: In
five years time,

00:00:01.458 --> 00:00:07.210
what is your idea of Web heaven,
Web hell-- assuming everything

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.109
goes right,
everything goes wrong?

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.400
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, I'm going
with utopian and dystopian,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.710
because it feels more
"Blade Runner"-ish.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.230
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.200
Oh, great film, yeah.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.580
PAUL LEWIS: No.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.455
It's not a good film.

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:16.860
It's a terrible film.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.570
I don't even know
why I brought it up.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.230
I don't even like the movie.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.470
I watched it, right?

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.750
It's one of those movies.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.670
I'm one of these people
that people go, oh, you've

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.660
never seen that movie?

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.250
You are terrible human being.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.170
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm
still getting past

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.850
I don't like "Blade Runner."

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.490
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.989
Right.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.340
This does come back into that.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.380
There are loads of
movies where you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.340
get told that it's a classic
and a must watch, ooh, all that.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.590
So you then go, fine.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.090
All right.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.450
Fine.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.950
I'll buy it.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.639
It's $5.99 on Play, HD
version, because you've

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:46.930
got to go HD, because whatever.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.384
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Of course.

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:49.050
Rules are rules.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.050
PAUL LEWIS: Rules are rules.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.750
And you do it.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.416
And you sit down to
watch it, and you've

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:54.474
got everything perfect.

00:00:54.474 --> 00:00:55.140
It's all set up.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.860
And you watch it and you
think, this is pathetic.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.360
This is a rubbish, rubbish
movie. "Highlander",

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.502
also terrible, with Sean
Connery's-- honestly,

00:01:04.502 --> 00:01:06.460
I've never heard a more
abysmal Spanish accent.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.970
(IMITATING SEAN
CONNERY) "My name

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.817
is Juan Sanchez
Villa Lobos Ramirez."

00:01:08.817 --> 00:01:09.650
You're not Spanish--

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.630
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, no!

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.320
Stop it!

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.100
Stop, stop, stop!

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.112
You're trying to say that
"Blade Runner" is bad

00:01:14.112 --> 00:01:15.320
because "Highlander" is bad--

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.260
PAUL LEWIS: No, no, no.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.260
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
You can't do that.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.560
That's not allowed.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.690
PAUL LEWIS: I'm saying
there's a principle at play

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.300
here that nostalgia
applies to movies.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.810
You bring it back in to your
"Blade Runner's" and you

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.210
look at it, and you go,
that's just not a good movie,

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.530
with Rutger Hauer going--
walking around, trying

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.990
to take out Harrison Ford.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.060
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
got Harrison Ford in it.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.768
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:01:33.768 --> 00:01:36.267
Now I'm told that I watched
the wrong cut of that movie,

00:01:36.267 --> 00:01:36.850
because I watched
the director's cut.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.930
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, because
you watched "Highlander",

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.430
clearly.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.870
PAUL LEWIS: No, I watched--

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.110
JAKE ARCHIBALD: The worst
thing about "Blade Runner"

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.543
was the Spanish accent
by Sean Connery.

00:01:43.543 --> 00:01:44.834
[GARBLED SEAN CONNERY MUMBLING]

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:45.334
No.

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:46.430
PAUL LEWIS: What was that?

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.930
What was that?

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.120
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That
was my impersonation

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.682
of your impersonation of Sean
Connery's Spanish accent.

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:51.890
PAUL LEWIS: That was perfect.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.810
Absolutely flawless.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.022
Anyway, in any case, you
come back to it and you go,

00:01:57.022 --> 00:01:58.480
"Blade Runner" is
not a good movie.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.940
And as I say, I watched the
director's cut, which I thought

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.554
would be the ultimate cut,
the one that's worth watching.

00:02:05.554 --> 00:02:07.470
Turn's out apparently I
watched the wrong one.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.330
Any movie that has enough
cuts to have a wrong one

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.009
is a movie that clearly
they couldn't make good.

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.175
JAKE ARCHIBALD: "Star Wars?"

00:02:15.175 --> 00:02:16.800
PAUL LEWIS: No,
they all got better,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.160
apart from the bit where
Han Solo went over the back

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.170
of Jabba the Hutt's--

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.750
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, come on.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.990
PAUL LEWIS: But anyway,
dystopian, utopian Web.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.045
Let's bring that back in.

00:02:33.045 --> 00:02:34.420
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
I don't know if I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.482
can trust your answer anymore.

00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:37.390
PAUL LEWIS: No.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.160
But flawless.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.119
My take on this is perfect.

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:41.660
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
your Web dystopia.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.360
Five years in future, the
Web is a dark horrible place

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.940
because all the things that
are starting to happen now

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.020
have just worse, or things
that could happen now

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.750
have got worse.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.040
PAUL LEWIS: Then you're
the only-- every time

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.620
you hit a URL the
first thing you see

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.816
is a door slam, where
you're told to download,

00:02:58.816 --> 00:03:00.940
and you can't skip past it
for at least 10 seconds.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.816
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yep, yep.

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:05.362
Or until you say
to your phone, I

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:07.820
promise to download the app
later, it has an audio feature.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.610
PAUL LEWIS: Well, no.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.776
That's the only way you get
to the Web experience is

00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:14.120
by forcing a download
or something.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.280
Then when the only people
who can build for the Web

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.059
are the elites.

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.475
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Like the Avengers.

00:03:20.475 --> 00:03:21.800
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah,
like the Avengers.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.300
The Web Avengers.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.585
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Tony
Stark is the only person

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:24.710
who can build websites.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.793
PAUL LEWIS: Essentially,
yeah, because the tooling

00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:30.530
has become so complex and
complicated that only an AI can

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.570
build for the Web.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.740
What else I think would
be absolutely terrible?

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.542
Everything just runs abysmally,
because the frameworks are

00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:43.000
so heavy, and the tooling is
so heavy that nothing actually

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.600
runs well.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.890
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
I think that there's

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.431
sort of knock on effect of that
is that if the Web dies, then

00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:49.510
you're going to see--
we have a problem

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.780
today with the amount
of operating systems

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.810
we have with mobiles.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.060
And it shouldn't be like that.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.268
Because now if you want to
start in the mobile space,

00:03:57.268 --> 00:03:59.240
you have to have a huge
app ecosystem already.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.850
And that's not going to happen.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.027
So I think that problem gets
worse if the Web weakens.

00:04:05.027 --> 00:04:06.110
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, I agree.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.510
I think it's interesting
that because you've

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.220
got these operating
systems and what's

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.700
going to naturally
happen is you're

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.230
going to want these apps
to start communicating

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.790
with each other, or
link to each other,

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.280
or in some other way be a
sort of streaming experience

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.280
or something like that.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.790
And you just kind of
go, that's the Web.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.574
What you're trying to emulate
is potentially the Web.

00:04:29.574 --> 00:04:31.240
JAKE ARCHIBALD: There's
XKCD about that.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.320
So much imagine if an app
could be dynamically loaded,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.070
and there was some
easy way to transfer it

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.870
from one person to another.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.661
Yeah, it's the Web.

00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:38.990
PAUL LEWIS: It's the Web.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.120
What we need is the Web to
just continue to get stronger

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.944
and to be a part of
this overall story.

00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:46.860
I don't think it's the
only part of the story.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.026
I think we disagree on that.

00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:50.800
But I do think it's
one very strong

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.191
and-- it's a pillar of
modern digital worlds.

00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:54.690
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
Web utopia, then.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.490
Five years time, everything's
going brilliantly.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.660
PAUL LEWIS: Well, you
can answer that one.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.730
Because I've done the dystopia.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.270
I'm quite--

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.140
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You're the
downer, along with your I

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.545
don't like "Blade Runner"
because it's "Highlander",

00:05:05.545 --> 00:05:06.670
"Highlander", "Highlander".

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:07.711
PAUL LEWIS: It's rubbish.

00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:09.480
Because it's rubbish.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.930
The plot took two hours--

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.894
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I don't
want to get into it, mate.

00:05:13.894 --> 00:05:16.309
Five years time,
utopia on the Web.

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:17.850
PAUL LEWIS: Utopia
on the Web, go on.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.280
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Utopia on the Web.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.000
Five years time.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.320
I think we'll see the
apps that you and I use

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.170
today that are native will
be done just on the Web,

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.780
like the Twitter clients,
like the Facebook clients,

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.140
like what other apps do I use?

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.090
Hangouts.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.360
These things can be done
just through the Web,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.010
and you write it once, and it's
working on multiple platforms.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.530
That's the utopia.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.196
Because we're getting
really close there

00:05:44.196 --> 00:05:45.180
with [? Asamjest ?].

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.721
This is one of the
things that I know

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.690
a browser is better at than us.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.630
So I thought I would say
that's the utopia, just

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.440
the Web being the first answer,
and native being the exception.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.090
