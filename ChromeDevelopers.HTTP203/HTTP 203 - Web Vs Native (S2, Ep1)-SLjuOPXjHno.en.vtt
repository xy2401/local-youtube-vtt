00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:01.250
PAUL LEWIS: So we're back.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.620
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.280
PAUL LEWIS: And
I've grown a beard

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.270
in the interim, where I think
gives it a distinct, you know,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.710
distinguished look.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.720
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
just to have some hair,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.470
right, in a place.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.382
PAUL LEWIS: To be fair, I think
it's a character progression.

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:15.090
Those who are more
important to the plot,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.082
they obviously progress
more than perhaps,

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:19.040
say others, because the
only progression you're

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.480
offering right now
seems to be a plaster

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.570
on the side of your head.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
the plaster, yes.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.580
PAUL LEWIS: Yes, the plaster.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.820
What are you doing, exactly?

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.054
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, I
had a shaving accident.

00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:28.970
PAUL LEWIS: What are you
shaving up there for?

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.303
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's not really.

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:35.100
Actually, I had an allergic
reaction to some sun cream.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.280
PAUL LEWIS: Really?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.460
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
of all the things,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.650
I need sun cream really badly.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.030
If I'm developing an
allergic reaction to that,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.000
I am properly screwed.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.010
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah it's
like everything hates you.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.690
At this point, it's just
like something's just

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.840
trying to fry you to a crisp.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.880
You're basically stuffed.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.760
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm speaking
at a conference that--

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.480
PAUL LEWIS: It's not
in Barbados, is it?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.122
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
in Austin in July.

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:00.860
Yeah, I know, right?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.240
I am going to walk off the
plane and then just BOOF!

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.948
I'm just going to be
turned into a shadow

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:06.000
on the side of the wall.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.899
That's me going--

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.315
PAUL LEWIS: Some
smoking trailers.

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:09.642
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:12.122
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.320
PAUL LEWIS: Web versus native.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.490
That's still getting a lot of
air time, and that bothers me.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.690
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It
will until native dies.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.860
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah,
you fall into that--

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.110
a little bit of the zealot
camp sometimes, don't you?

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.790
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, OK.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.480
PAUL LEWIS: You're like, the
web should do everything.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: The web
should do everything.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.450
PAUL LEWIS: No, it shouldn't.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.199
JAKE ARCHIBALD: What
shouldn't the web do?

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:37.660
PAUL LEWIS: There's nothing
wrong with native taking over--

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.535
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Whoa!

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:40.810
PAUL LEWIS: --when
you want closeness

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.420
to the platform in question.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.937
That's OK.

00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:44.270
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.687
There's some stuff that native
is actually good for today.

00:01:46.687 --> 00:01:47.561
JAKE ARCHIBALD: What?

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:49.050
Tell me what it's good for.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.701
What do you use native for
that can't be done on the web?

00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:53.700
PAUL LEWIS: I think offline
is still not sorted,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.820
and I think notifications--

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.480
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Offline's sorted.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.620
We fixed offline.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.630
ServiceWorker shipped at
the start of the year.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.740
PAUL LEWIS: Not for iOS, right?

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.675
Like, for example, if
you talk about what

00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:07.580
apps do I use on
native, it's Tweetbot

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.590
is one of the most obvious
ones, email as well.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.310
I'll do that.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.947
Again, it's offline,
and most of them

00:02:12.947 --> 00:02:14.405
give me notifications
like Tweetbot

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:16.363
will let me know when
I've got a direct message

00:02:16.363 --> 00:02:19.551
or when somebody @replies
me, which the web can't do.

00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:21.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We've got
notifications as well.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.050
Chrome 42.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.830
PAUL LEWIS: What
the web will do.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.641
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
But that does do--

00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:27.890
I mean, OK, it's only on
Chrome at the moment, Firefox

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.540
coming soon, but that's
the web doing it, right?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.300
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, but today,
it's still a bit iffy.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.880
Given a long enough
timeline, yes, I

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.630
think the web will
take those bits,

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.540
and there will be
more things that

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.750
can be done on web
that you would do on

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.110
native today, right?

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.380
So that's absolutely fine.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.319
What I still think is-- there's
this sort of smooth on-ramp

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.110
for the web, right?

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.750
Where it's like you
give somebody a URL.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.570
There's no app stores.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.410
There's no play stores.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.010
There's nothing like that.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.680
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You
inherit shareability

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.010
by just being able to give
someone that bit of text,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.674
and they will get to see the
thing you were looking at.

00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:01.840
PAUL LEWIS: And so there's
no friction there, right?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.584
Just go to the
URL, do the thing.

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:05.500
Hopefully it will answer
your question, right?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.375
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:08.720
Yeah, and when we
compare native to web,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.980
I feel that we often
compare it like no-cache web

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.280
to installed app when
really you should

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.400
be comparing non-installed app.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.830
You have to go to the app store.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.035
You install that megabytes worth
of stuff, whereas the web, you

00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:20.280
just get your own--
get the content.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.030
PAUL LEWIS: Right.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.490
But at the same time, that's
slightly ludicrous to say,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.090
to use this app, you must
first install this app, right?

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.180
But that's the web's
model, is to say,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.610
you've got to go from cold.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.480
We assume you've got nothing.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.786
With native, we're
going to assume you can,

00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:36.910
that you've got it already.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.890
JAKE ARCHIBALD: For me,
that's the joy of the web.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.440
As you say, someone
gives you a URL,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.077
and you could be with the
content in just seconds later.

00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:45.160
Even though you've never
been to that site before,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.550
you don't have to go and
install megabytes of stuff.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.470
You just get it.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.510
I really hate that so
many websites circumvent

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.070
that part of the web.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.086
You'll get a website which
wants to-- wants you to answer

00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:58.710
a survey before you
can see the content

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.272
or wants you to download
the native app before you

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:01.220
can see the content.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.011
PAUL LEWIS: No, no.

00:04:02.011 --> 00:04:02.890
Always no, no, no.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.664
I'm not here for your survey.

00:04:04.664 --> 00:04:06.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Have you ever seen

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.475
someone trying to take a
survey in London Bridge?

00:04:08.475 --> 00:04:09.100
PAUL LEWIS: No.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.370
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well,
they're standing there,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.599
clipboard in hand.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.890
Everyone comes off the train,
but no one wants to stop.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.348
Everyone knows
where they're going.

00:04:15.348 --> 00:04:17.779
You see the look of horror
on the face of the person

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:18.720
with the clipboard.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.180
It reminds me of that
scene in "Lion King" where

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.730
Simba's in the canyon and
all the wildebeests come down

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.230
on them.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.840
And I say don't-- when
people want to do a thing,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.410
they've got a destination to
get to, don't start getting

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.210
in their way.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.940
PAUL LEWIS: Fact.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.356
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
And this is why we

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.896
hate the kind of-- do you want
to install our native apps?

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:36.895
No, I've gone to the URL
with the bit of content

00:04:36.895 --> 00:04:38.170
that I would like.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.660
Why can't you just show me that?

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.700
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.946
Finally, on the whole
web versus native thing,

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:44.320
the thing I do
definitely love is

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.840
that there's no SDK
download for the web, right?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You don't
have to build the Eclipse

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.905
monstrosity thing.

00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:53.260
You don't have to dump
that on your machine.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.540
I mean, even things like Xcode,
how many gigabytes is Xcode?

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.870
PAUL LEWIS: Five or six.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.411
I can't believe I
actually knew that.

00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:00.930
That was a little bit weird.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.540
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And with the
web, it's just a text file.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.580
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.047
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You can write
DOCTYPE, HTML, Hello World--

00:05:09.047 --> 00:05:11.380
PAUL LEWIS: Don't have to do
the DOCTYPE, if I'm honest.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.970
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think you
do have to do the DOCTYPE.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.050
PAUL LEWIS: Don't have to.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.883
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You
don't want it in quotes,

00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:17.310
but OK, even then,
you could have

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.230
something working in a browser.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.700
It's super easy to get started.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.450
