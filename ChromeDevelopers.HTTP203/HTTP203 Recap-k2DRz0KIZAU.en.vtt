PAUL LEWIS: We tend
to talk about the web.

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.560
And today, I think,
is no different.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.030
But you think you
can beat Wikipedia

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.740
at a server-side render, do you?

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.150
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I did.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.310
[INAUDIBLE], too,
the rules all change.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.400
PAUL LEWIS: One code base
is not what you want,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.920
because then you end
up with stagnation.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.150
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I have got
one function that actually

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.316
produces the other function.

00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:21.286
It's almost become
self-aware, and the code

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:22.910
is now writing itself.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.710
What time does the game start?

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.810
PAUL LEWIS: Eh.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.910
Tuesday?

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.460
Hm.
