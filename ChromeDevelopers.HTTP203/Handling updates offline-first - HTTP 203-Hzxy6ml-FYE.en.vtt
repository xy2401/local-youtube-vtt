JAKE ARCHIBALD: You think
you just die overnight,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.850
and you wake up in the morning?

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.300
SURMA: Isn't that what sleep is?

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.133
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:05.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.423
Let's say yes.

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:07.590
Let's say that's what it is.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.057
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.040
So.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.079
SURMA: So.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Offline first--

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.860
SURMA: Right.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.290
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
--is a good thing.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.015
It's something--

00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:20.890
SURMA: Is it, though?

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.270
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Is it, though?

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.010
Yes is the answer.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.535
SURMA: I tend to
agree, actually.

00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:26.910
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
And we talk about

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.630
offline first as being
distinct from online first.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.130
Right?

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.840
Offline first means it's just--

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.020
do you try getting
offline content first,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.360
or do you try and get it later?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.990
SURMA: Yeah.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.960
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's the rule.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.600
So if you were to build
something online first,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.770
the idea is, you go to
the network, and then--

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.080
SURMA: That's just how
everybody builds websites

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.520
most of the time traditionally.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.420
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.320
Well, a lot are
built online only.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.820
SURMA: Ah.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.370
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So the online
first would be if that fails,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.068
then show some content.

00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:54.610
SURMA: Right.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.985
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
But offline first

00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:59.060
is best, because it
works in more situations.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.560
SURMA: Yeah.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.020
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So if
you're doing online first,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.990
it works great when
you're offline.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.480
SURMA: As the name
kind of implies.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.730
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.698
It fails quickly, and then it
goes for the cached content.

00:01:09.698 --> 00:01:10.240
SURMA: Right.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.760
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But there's
another situation that

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.000
is different, and
it is this, which

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.998
I have been desperately trying
to make an industry term.

00:01:18.998 --> 00:01:21.415
SURMA: You've been coining
this one, right, over and over.

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:22.665
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Over and over.

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.520
I want my Ajax.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.670
Where's my-- I want to be
famous like the guy who invented

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.170
Ajax--

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.350
SURMA: Who obviously--

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.450
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --who
I don't know his name.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.430
My plan is ruined.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.110
There's a real problem here.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.003
Remy invented--

00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:37.670
SURMA: Polyfill.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.930
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --polyfill.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.290
Right, see?

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.040
SURMA: I'm jealous of that one.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.300
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Famous.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.000
SURMA: That's a good one.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.450
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
That is a good one.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.180
SURMA: That's a good one.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.400
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So this is
a situation where your phone

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.230
thinks it has a connection,
but it doesn't--

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.730
SURMA: Which you
have all the time--

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.585
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --which
is all the time.

00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:50.043
SURMA: --especially when you're
on vacation or in airports,

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:50.817
in my experience.

00:01:50.817 --> 00:01:52.900
JAKE ARCHIBALD: When you
need it most essentially.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.870
And the phone doesn't
think it's offline,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.480
so it sits there trying to
make a connection for ages,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.720
and it never gets there.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.010
And that is a problem.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.870
SURMA: Especially
when you know the app

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.870
has the content offline, but it
shows a spinner for 30 seconds,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.229
like, "I think I'm online,
so I'm rather going to try--"

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.229
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's--

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.860
SURMA: Online first.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.699
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
That's online first.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.919
SURMA: And that's stupid.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:10.752
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:02:10.752 --> 00:02:12.370
So offline first,
we agree is better.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.710
It works in more
situations, but that

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.700
means you are serving content
from your caches first.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.575
Then you go and go, "Is
there anything new?"

00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:21.200
And sometimes--

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.620
SURMA: There might
be something new.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.495
JAKE ARCHIBALD: There
might be something new,

00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:26.590
and then what do you do?

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.300
SURMA: Well, I
mean, I think we all

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.700
have seen the infamous
snack bar, right?

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: This is
the solution in Squoosh.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.000
The page loads.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.800
It goes off.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.000
It finds an update.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.130
I mean, meanwhile, you could
be using the app or whatever,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.005
and a little thing pops up at
the bottom there and says--

00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:43.930
SURMA: Do we cancel?

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.260
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
a pinch-zooming app.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.890
SURMA: Right.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.040
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.100
SURMA: I forgot.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.000
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Forgot about that.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.330
And, yeah, it's saying
here, "Update available."

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.860
SURMA: And now do you
want to reload and lose

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.230
what you've already
working on, or do

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.655
you want to ignore the
fancy new features?

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:01.030
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But there
could be something really good.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.530
SURMA: Yes.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.780
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So you're
like, "I'm going to reload,"

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.130
and as you say, you just
lost all your stuff now.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.430
So that's great.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.360
This is a very common pattern.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.860
SURMA: Yeah.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.020
I see it a lot.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.120
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.400
SURMA: It seems to be the
standard pattern currently.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.108
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
the standard pattern

00:03:17.108 --> 00:03:19.570
especially for app
updates, where it's also

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.200
updating not just the content
but also like the underlying

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.200
JavaScript and CSS.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.700
SURMA: Yeah.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.330
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Because what you got

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.760
there was a full page
reload, it means the browser

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.215
can start from scratch.

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:31.090
SURMA: Get all the new
things from the cache.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.870
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, it's
not trying to mix the two.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.160
SURMA: [INAUDIBLE]
consistent update.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.827
Yeah, because that's
the problem, right?

00:03:34.827 --> 00:03:36.910
Especially in a world
where what we advocate for

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.343
is hash all your styles and--

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.010
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yep,
yep, yep, yep, yep.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.343
SURMA: And use HP cache as well.

00:03:41.343 --> 00:03:43.780
Then do it-- suddenly
loading new styles

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.990
while having loaded the
old app shell, for example,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.120
could get you in a
really iffy spot,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.537
so the only safe way to do it
is, we like a proper reload.

00:03:51.537 --> 00:03:53.828
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And this is
what native apps do, right?

00:03:53.828 --> 00:03:54.380
SURMA: Fair.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.005
I mean, yeah, they have the apps
where they actually get killed

00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:58.870
when the App Store
puts in new updates.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.787
JAKE ARCHIBALD: The thing
that native apps can

00:04:00.787 --> 00:04:02.850
do that the web can't do
yet is do all the update

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.860
in the background.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.360
SURMA: Yeah.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.230
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
So you're usually

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.940
coming to the latest version.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.540
Not always.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.570
Sometimes you still get
the app kill experience.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.280
SURMA: Yeah.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.100
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
And so we're going

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.740
to have a look at some ways
that we can improve on this.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.180
What other ways are there?

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.440
What improvements can we make?

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.960
But I always want to
caveat that in, this

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.113
is not a solved problem.

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:24.780
SURMA: It's not.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.690
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And it's not--

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.232
when I say it's not
a solved problem,

00:04:27.232 --> 00:04:29.650
it's not just the web
that hasn't caught up.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.300
Go into airplane mode
or, better, Lie-Fi mode,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.110
if you can find a way
to do that, and just

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.140
try a few native apps.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.640
SURMA: Yeah.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.610
It's super hard.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.110
So many--

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
you get it wrong.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.640
SURMA: Pretty much all
the apps get it wrong.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.515
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:42.050
You will see so
many empty screens.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.110
SURMA: And it also
depends on the use case.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.850
Some apps need-- cannot
afford to show stale data.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.445
There's use cases where that
is actually unacceptable.

00:04:51.445 --> 00:04:52.570
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Absolutely.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.460
So what could do better here?

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.543
If we have a think about
what some of the problems

00:04:56.543 --> 00:04:58.630
that we actually created
here, the first one

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.560
is that we lost all the state.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.840
SURMA: Yeah, which we could
work around, because we

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.923
had control of the button.

00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:06.140
We could use [INAUDIBLE]
or something.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.640
Right?

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.240
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.430
So you want, when you
click that reload button,

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.310
to essentially put the user back
into the same state they were,

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.210
but--

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.017
SURMA: That's hard.

00:05:14.017 --> 00:05:15.100
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But with--

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.240
well, in some apps it is.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.950
Some apps, it isn't.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.350
SURMA: True.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.517
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It depends--

00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:21.060
it comes down to how you
can store that state.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.560
SURMA: Yeah.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.960
Also, you might have shipped
a major upgrade to your app.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.220
What if you changed
your state model,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.338
or you even removed
or added functionality

00:05:29.338 --> 00:05:31.880
that's just incompatible with
what the user was doing before?

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.300
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.290
SURMA: It gets very
complicated very quickly.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.290
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So the
simplest thing you can do

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.638
is, if you've got real URLs,
you're a long way there--

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:39.430
SURMA: That's true.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.370
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
--because you refresh.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.760
You're going to reload
that URL, and you're

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.680
going to send the user to a
place roughly similar to where

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.410
they were before.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.140
SURMA: That's true.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.230
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
not what we did here.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.760
SURMA: It's not.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.230
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.522
SURMA: Well, we would have
to encode the image somehow,

00:05:51.522 --> 00:05:52.700
and it just gets iffy.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.060
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And so our
choice there is sessionStorage.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.770
SURMA: Oh, right.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.080
You keep talking about it,
and we've never used it yet.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.747
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We've
never used it yet.

00:06:01.747 --> 00:06:04.950
So this is a great tool for
remembering state like this.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.882
So anything you put in
sessionStorage is essentially--

00:06:08.882 --> 00:06:11.166
e-session-illy-- essentially--

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:11.666
SURMA: Aye.

00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:13.850
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --associated.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.278
I've now forgotten how to speak.

00:06:16.278 --> 00:06:16.820
That's great.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.632
SURMA: Good thing
that's paid for.

00:06:18.632 --> 00:06:20.360
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.670
You can associate
data with the tab.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.460
SURMA: Which is actually really
useful, because another thing

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.760
that we didn't even
mention, if you have a tab

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.445
and you want to store some state
so you can do the reloads--

00:06:32.445 --> 00:06:33.320
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.540
SURMA: --what if two tabs
do that at the same time?

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.617
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:06:36.617 --> 00:06:38.450
SURMA: They would just
overwrite each other.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.230
What would happen?

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.502
Because on the web, the same app
can be opened multiple times.

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:44.210
Another problem that
native doesn't have.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.020
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes, yes.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.330
So if you were to use normal
local storage or IndexedDB

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.090
or something like that,
if you use it naively,

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.002
two tabs store to the same
place, blasting winds.

00:06:53.002 --> 00:06:55.460
They refresh, and you get two
tabs going to the same place.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.080
SURMA: Not unsolvable, but hard.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.870
Sessionstore sorts
that out for free.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.750
SURMA: Right.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.720
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You
can only store text.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.220
SURMA: Bad.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.820
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So that was--

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.560
SURMA: And it's main thread,
and it's synchronous, isn't it?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.497
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:07:06.497 --> 00:07:06.997
Yeah.

00:07:06.997 --> 00:07:12.490
I mean, synchronous-- you're
only using it very quickly.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.518
What you do, as soon as
the user says, "Yes, I

00:07:14.518 --> 00:07:15.310
want this update"--

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.630
SURMA: In this use
case, it would be fine.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.370
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You put the
stuff into sessionStorage.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.450
You then reload the
page as you would.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.742
But then the first thing your
app does when it wakes up

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:23.830
is go, "Did I have--"

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.490
[IMITATING MACHINE NOISES]

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly that.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.150
And you have to turn
your speakers off,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.448
because it does make
that noise every time.

00:07:33.448 --> 00:07:35.990
And then you can use that to
put your app back into the state

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.030
that it was, JSON
decode it or whatever.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:39.530
SURMA: Yeah.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.685
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And make that
your state object, whatever,

00:07:41.685 --> 00:07:41.930
whatever.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.680
SURMA: Which, for an
image, would actually

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.100
be quite cumbersome yet again.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.030
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes,
because you would

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.830
hit the sessionStorage
limit very quickly.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.913
But it's these two little
things that would really

00:07:49.913 --> 00:07:51.280
improve what we're doing--

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:51.863
SURMA: Agreed.

00:07:51.863 --> 00:07:54.170
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --with Squoosh.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.140
Another example, do
you recognize this?

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.115
SURMA: Oh, Jake, this
is one of the other apps

00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:02.490
that you built in your lifetime
and you keep bringing up.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.420
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yep, that's it.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.493
I spent most my career
making websites that

00:08:05.493 --> 00:08:06.660
have checkered backgrounds--

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.710
SURMA: Approaches
the first one--

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.860
I mean, I guess in a way
it still has a checkered--

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.840
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's still
very grid-based, I suppose.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.590
I make grids.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.340
That's what I do.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.620
That's how I make my money.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.710
This site, I went for basically
the same model as Squoosh,

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.940
in that it has the banner and
says, "Got an update for you

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.270
there.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.160
Do you want it?"

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.194
But there's an
exception to the rule.

00:08:31.194 --> 00:08:32.030
SURMA: Ooh.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.590
JAKE ARCHIBALD: If it
finds out about that update

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.140
while it is still
on this screen,

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.439
and the user hasn't interacted
yet, it just reloads.

00:08:40.439 --> 00:08:42.799
SURMA: Ah, because this
is how the app starts,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.330
so it's basically a
non-visual change.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.930
JAKE ARCHIBALD: A
non-visual change,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.370
so as far as the user
sees, the page reloads.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.370
And I also added this
sort of telling the user--

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.328
SURMA: Oh, look at you.

00:08:53.328 --> 00:08:54.430
You're such a nice person.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.577
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Well, I think this--

00:08:56.577 --> 00:08:58.410
I think I've done this
the wrong way around.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.430
And this is something
I've been thinking

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.110
about recently, is when
that little banner comes up,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.790
especially if it ends up in
a banner situation, and says,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.180
"There's an update available.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:07.980
Do you want it?"

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.020
I'm like, "I don't know
what's in the box."

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.890
Right.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.220
Tell me what's in the box.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.030
Do I want-- because
if it's like, oh,

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.930
it's a bug fix to the
feature you don't use--

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:16.970
SURMA: Fix it for
the odd browser.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.030
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Fix it for the
odd browser that you're not on,

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.000
which would be a problem that
would still be a service worker

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.500
update.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.400
So it could be a fix
that you literally

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.520
will not benefit from at all.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.280
So letting-- you know, I think
there's an opportunity that's

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.110
trying to sell
the user on, yeah,

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.360
you want to click this button.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.400
SURMA: You want to click it.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.950
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
going to really--

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:34.990
SURMA: Well, in this
case, you tell me about it

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.240
after I clicked it.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.865
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes, like I say,
I got it the wrong way around.

00:09:38.865 --> 00:09:39.430
Chill out.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.430
But it's actually not too
bad in this situation,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.388
because the user didn't
have to click anything.

00:09:43.388 --> 00:09:44.575
SURMA: True.

00:09:44.575 --> 00:09:46.500
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I get
away with this here

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.870
because the home page
here, it's quite boring.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.720
SURMA: There's a
lot of free space

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.933
to just show a change log.

00:09:52.933 --> 00:09:54.600
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
also nothing moving.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.880
SURMA: Yeah, any
animation will basically

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.420
disrupt the illusion of
a transparent reload.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Because
you would see that reload.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:00.770
SURMA: Yeah.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.560
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And because it
all goes for a service worker,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.600
the reload is really fast.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.850
But yes, if there was an
animation or something there,

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.490
you would see that
stop-start, which

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.110
takes us to another website.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.500
Once again, I'm going to
purely just talk about things

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.690
that I had some involvement
on, but this is one

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.100
that you had an involvement in.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.110
SURMA: Oh, yeah,
I'm OK with this.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.790
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
You're fine with this?

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.030
SURMA: Yeah.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.250
It's OK.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.860
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.090
SURMA: I like this one a lot.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.923
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So--

00:10:21.923 --> 00:10:23.030
SURMA: So we built a game.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.363
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We built a game.

00:10:24.363 --> 00:10:27.540
It's like "Minesweeper,"
essentially, and this is it.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.140
But it came to the bit where
I did the service work a bit,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.030
and it came to the bit to
handle updates, and I was just--

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.030
SURMA: We went through a
few iterations on this.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.830
We had different
things we tried out.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.497
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well,
I started bringing

00:10:39.497 --> 00:10:41.700
in the code to do the
same thing as Squoosh.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.190
There's an update available,
and I just found myself

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.690
feeling really depressed about
the whole thing, because it's

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.300
like this is a
horrible situation.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.960
And I knew I couldn't do
the same thing with SVGOMG,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.770
because you would-- this
lovely background that you made

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.380
and this lovely
intro that I made--

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.630
anyway, can't do
the reload thing,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.860
because of the animations.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.910
Didn't want to do the banner
thing, because it's horrible.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:05.760
SURMA: Right.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.580
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So I actually
went back to something that--

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.498
I've seen sites like
Flipkart do this,

00:11:10.498 --> 00:11:12.540
and it was also something
I did with Lanyard back

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.510
in the day, which is
find an opportunity

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.640
to reload when you can.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.873
SURMA: Yeah, because the
start page is just this.

00:11:21.873 --> 00:11:24.040
If you can't reload here,
because they might already

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.690
be configuring, maybe
it was something

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.300
further down the line.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.820
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And so when
you press the start button,

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.370
if there is an update available,
rather than just launching

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.350
into the game, which
you usually do,

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.050
it does the
sessionStorage trick.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.800
But it doesn't put a
lot of data in there.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.175
All it puts in is the type of
game that's about to start.

00:11:40.175 --> 00:11:42.508
SURMA: That's all you need,
because that's all the input

00:11:42.508 --> 00:11:43.560
it has been given so far.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.060
The game hasn't
been generated yet,

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.123
so we don't need to
store the entire field.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.540
You can just say,
"This user wants

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.190
to play a game on easy mode."

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.220
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yep, and then
it reloads the page and--

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.840
SURMA: Which causes
a new game logic

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.600
if there is no game
logic to be loaded.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.830
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And it
will find that-- yeah, it

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.070
will go, "Oh, there's
something in sessionStorage.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.470
I'm just going to start again."

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.020
SURMA: Yeah.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.980
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And here's
what that looks like.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.500
So you actually
saw a reload there.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.000
It does a bit more
loading up front,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.785
because we're
generating the sprites,

00:12:10.785 --> 00:12:12.390
and normally it would pull
those out of the cache.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.680
But it's a new version, so--

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.550
SURMA: Need to build new ones.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.008
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It
builds new ones,

00:12:16.008 --> 00:12:18.480
and it loads, and
it's not too bad.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.170
SURMA: No.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:19.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
It's not too bad.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.110
SURMA: Look at that.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You really--

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.420
yeah.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.545
You did the animation work.

00:12:23.545 --> 00:12:25.170
Well done.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.062
But it means that you
can see it kind of gives

00:12:28.062 --> 00:12:29.520
the game away a
little bit when you

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.312
see a URL bar, because
we'll see this start

00:12:31.312 --> 00:12:32.430
to spin very briefly.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.140
But it's loading from a service
worker, so it's really fast.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.210
SURMA: It's really
fast enough, yeah.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.140
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But it's
even less noticeable--

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.240
SURMA: Only when you know
it, you actually notice it,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:39.480
I think.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:39.840
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.180
SURMA: I don't think many
players know what's happening.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.590
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, they do
now if they're watching this.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.820
SURMA: OK.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.280
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Don't they?

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.430
That's the whole
point of this video.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.910
SURMA: Jake.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.780
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Do you not
realize we have some viewers?

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.720
Not many.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.290
Some though.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.040
SURMA: Few loyal ones.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.457
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Few loyal viewers.

00:12:51.457 --> 00:12:52.165
SURMA: Shout out.

00:12:52.165 --> 00:12:53.790
I really like this
pattern, by the way.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.695
I think it's a really nice one
which probably doesn't apply

00:12:56.695 --> 00:12:58.850
to things like a blog,
but every kind of app

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:02.390
could probably have a
situation where a click could

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.190
be turned into a reload
and then navigate

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.790
to wherever you wanted to go.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:05.360
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.250
Yes, and as I say, I've
seen content sites do

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.990
this, where you click a link.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.570
It's very possible you're going
to do a navigation anyway.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:11.780
SURMA: Yeah.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.072
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But It makes
the service worker updates

00:13:14.072 --> 00:13:14.835
at the same time.

00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:15.710
You're right, though.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.928
Content sites,
slightly different.

00:13:18.928 --> 00:13:20.720
Like the Twitter model,
it's something they

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.250
will say, "There's new content.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.660
Do you want to see it?"

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.202
It's still a click
away, but it's not

00:13:25.202 --> 00:13:26.600
a full page reload away.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.310
Something like a chat app.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.830
If you scroll to the bottom,
you just add the new stuff,

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:31.778
and you scroll to it.

00:13:31.778 --> 00:13:32.570
SURMA: Pretty much.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.910
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's easy.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.660
I've been thinking a
little bit about what

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.453
we would do for something
that is a bit more content-y.

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:42.113
SURMA: Yeah.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:44.280
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So this is
a blog post, essentially.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.120
SURMA: Yeah.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.480
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And--

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.180
SURMA: So use basically
is now your user

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.260
went to the site, started
reading the log post,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.650
but we just published
a little typo fix

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.887
or maybe added a whole paragraph
of new, important information.

00:13:57.887 --> 00:13:58.720
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.530
SURMA: What do you do?

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:00.490
JAKE ARCHIBALD: What do you do?

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.090
And this is where--

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.010
I think, well, you started
mentioning earlier.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.780
You could do different
things depending

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.335
on the age of the content,
the type of the content.

00:14:09.335 --> 00:14:13.077
SURMA: And you could build
something smart or dumb.

00:14:13.077 --> 00:14:15.660
You could do something-- oh, if
the content that I'm replacing

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.788
is not on screen, you could
go in and actually inject it.

00:14:18.788 --> 00:14:20.205
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
That is the dream.

00:14:20.205 --> 00:14:20.640
Right?

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.080
You are prepared to
go to that much effort

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.370
to realize that the user--

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:23.820
SURMA: It's hard.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.278
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
--is off the screen

00:14:25.278 --> 00:14:26.890
and just sneakily update it.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.300
But I would say,
with a blog post,

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.680
I think a model I want to try--

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.310
I haven't actually
tried this, but I

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.258
think it's a workable pattern,
is go somewhere between online

00:14:38.258 --> 00:14:39.300
first and offline first--

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:39.960
SURMA: Yeah.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.270
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --where you
would deliver straightaway

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:47.310
the shell of the page, so
the bar across the top there,

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.290
and get ready to stream
the rest of the content in.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.550
And then if that hasn't happened
for a second and a half,

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.500
if you haven't got
any new data, then

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.440
that's your cue to
show something like,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.440
"This is taking a while.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.577
Do you want to look
at the cached data?"

00:15:00.577 --> 00:15:02.160
And you could take
that option and say

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.440
how old the cache data
is, so that the user can

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.720
make an informed decision.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.600
SURMA: I think the last thing
I built, I actually delivered

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.810
from cache, but if the
new content was completely

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.930
done downloading within 500
milliseconds of the page being

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.430
on screen, I would
just swap it out.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.190
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Just swap it.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:18.750
That--

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.300
SURMA: Because I felt--

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --is really
difficult to get right.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.940
SURMA: --like the
user wouldn't have

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.440
engaged with the
page enough to have

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.060
settled into a scroll position.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.210
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's true.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.560
SURMA: It's not a
perfect experience.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.780
It would probably flicker,
because you might have

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.010
already scrolled, maybe not.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.300
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's got the
same problem as web fonts.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:30.725
SURMA: Yeah.

00:15:30.725 --> 00:15:31.642
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right?

00:15:31.642 --> 00:15:34.222
You have the possibility
of content moving around.

00:15:34.222 --> 00:15:35.680
Like you say, if
it's early enough,

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.763
it might not be a problem.

00:15:36.763 --> 00:15:40.710
But if you give the user
the opportunity to decide,

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.320
that could be a model
worth going for,

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.400
and that way you're not just
waiting until the content fails

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.350
to load before you let
the user at the content

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.180
already on the device.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.550
You give them the option.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.082
The other way is to essentially
go back to the banner thing,

00:15:55.082 --> 00:15:56.790
or have something
across the top saying--

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.190
SURMA: "This is outdated."

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.390
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
--"This is outdated."

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.570
This is the data that--

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.100
SURMA: Which again, then
always I wonder, "Well, what's

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.150
the change?

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.825
I want to know what
you messed up."

00:16:04.825 --> 00:16:06.450
I don't want it to
reload, because this

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:07.280
is the wrong version.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:07.950
What was your mistake?

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.660
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Duplicate tab, update,

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.400
and then put both side by side.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.100
SURMA: Visual differences.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.090
JAKE ARCHIBALD: What's
the factual difference?

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.640
Yeah, with a blog
post, it's probably

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.920
fine to let the user look
at the stale content,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.290
but, yeah, if you're
a new site, if you're

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.470
displaying life and
death information,

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.370
that is when you were saying--

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.140
if I'm reading your blog
post that's 10 minutes old,

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:31.880
not a problem.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.550
SURMA: Probably fine.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.960
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Probably not.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.150
If you're reading one of my blog
posts that's 10 minutes old,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.620
you are missing out on some
serious spelling corrections,

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.460
which especially if I've just
published, because I will go

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.470
through and correct that a lot.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.462
But just spelling,
whereas if it's

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:45.920
a news story that's
10 minutes old,

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.790
that could be really serious.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:48.290
SURMA: Yeah.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.498
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But the web--

00:16:49.498 --> 00:16:50.990
you get the tools
to look at that.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.250
You can get to
make that decision.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:53.750
SURMA: Yeah.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.740
JAKE ARCHIBALD: If it's
just being a quick refresh--

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.742
SURMA: We definitely have
all the tools to build

00:16:56.742 --> 00:16:57.950
all these different patterns.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.070
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.290
SURMA: It's just a matter
of actually building them.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.420
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
that's basically

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.880
what I wanted to talk about.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.503
As I said, there's no kind of--

00:17:05.503 --> 00:17:07.670
SURMA: There's no bottom
line here really, is there?

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.119
JAKE ARCHIBALD: There's
some real examples there,

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.750
but it's something that I want
to see the web exploring more,

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.000
and I want to
explore on the web.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.359
I feel that we've got some
good patterns for apps.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.790
I would like to see it explored
a bit more for content.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.373
SURMA: Agreed.

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:21.530
Let's do that.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.582
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I had
this big, long animation,

00:17:23.582 --> 00:17:26.040
everything was flying around,
and I was really proud of it,

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.665
because I did it on a plane, and
when I presented it to people,

00:17:28.665 --> 00:17:30.630
everyone was like, "Oh."

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.830
SURMA: Let's go from 11 to two.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.740
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's a bit--

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.020
hmm.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.860
But I was really proud
of it at the time,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.660
so I was like, my
heart was ripped out.
