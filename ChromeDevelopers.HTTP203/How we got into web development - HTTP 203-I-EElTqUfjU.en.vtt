00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680
JAKE: Hey, Surma.

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.388
SURMA: Hey, Jake.

00:00:01.388 --> 00:00:02.400
JAKE: Do you like video?

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.100
SURMA: Yeah.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.805
JAKE: Say no.

00:00:03.805 --> 00:00:04.305
SURMA: No.

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:05.888
JAKE: Well, then,
did you know that we

00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:08.430
do a podcast which is like
this, but without the video

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.420
and with more sound?

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.907
It has bonus material and
you can put it in your ears.

00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:13.740
SURMA: Look at the
description for the link.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.690
So.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.130
JAKE: So.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.875
So.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:31.750
SURMA: So, I thought I
would bring something up.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.830
I had a couple of people
ask me at the conference

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.830
I've been recently, because
they asked me, like,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.870
what's your background.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.710
Like how did you end up
in doing what you do?

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.590
JAKE: I get emails like
this as well, saying,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.640
how did you get where you are?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.270
SURMA: And the answer
is usually dumb luck.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.320
JAKE: Yes.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.888
And that is always how I reply.

00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:54.430
And I think this is
a tweet that I've

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.500
mentioned on either the video
series or the podcast before.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.550
We do a podcast.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.290
We do a podcast.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.120
We do a podcast.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.620
There'll be a link.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.490
And my answer is
always, well, it's

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.750
like telling people the numbers
I used to win the lottery.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.670
And I'm not convinced--

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.340
SURMA: This might not be
helpful to you at all.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.060
JAKE: Yes.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.450
So I guess what we're going
to talk about our backgrounds

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.790
and how we got where we were.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.060
SURMA: I have no shame.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.768
JAKE: Well, yeah.

00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:24.850
And if you thought previous
episodes of HTTP203

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.890
were entirely self-indulgent,
you ain't seen nothing yet.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.925
This is the big one.

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:30.675
SURMA: I was born.

00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:31.450
JAKE: Yes, OK.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.430
This is going to
be a long episode.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.620
SURMA: No.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.530
I think from
looking at our team,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.600
I'm more on the traditional
side of how I end up here.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.510
I studoed computer
sciences, did my bachelors,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.930
started a masters.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.430
JAKE: Wait.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.930
Wait.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.760
So you did computer science
before your bachelor's?

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.810
Or what?

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.550
SURMA: Yeah.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.020
I had interests.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.260
I did the odd language
here and there.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.677
JAKE: And that was
at high school?

00:01:56.677 --> 00:01:58.135
Like, formally or
just on your own.

00:01:58.135 --> 00:01:59.350
SURMA: No, like self taught.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.990
Because it was not useful.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.343
The computer science class
or computer class that we had

00:02:04.343 --> 00:02:05.260
were not useful to me.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.100
And I already--

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.195
JAKE: Well, you did
have computer classes.

00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:07.778
SURMA: We did.

00:02:07.778 --> 00:02:09.083
JAKE: Right.

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.500
I feel like I'm having to
really dig for this information.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.030
SURMA: That's not what
I wanted to talk about.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.620
JAKE: Oh, sorry.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.810
OK.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.102
What do you want to talk about?

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:17.130
You just talk what you
want to talk about.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.160
I'll sit back.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.530
And you let me know when I'm
allowed to come in and ask

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.520
you some questions.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.070
SURMA: Well, I thought I'm
more traditional because I did,

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.630
in fact, actually study
computer sciences,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.020
which I know of people on
our team actually did not.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.080
Or I know a couple of
people also who did not.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.430
You are one example.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.630
Because you did not study.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.530
You studied--

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.550
JAKE: Multimedia.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.500
SURMA: Oh, that's very--

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.200
JAKE: What could be
better than media?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.810
Oh, multimedia.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.710
SURMA: It's like
multivitamin juice.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.300
JAKE: I want vitamin juice
or multivitamin juice.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.110
That's what I'm going for.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.610
SURMA: Yeah.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.405
And you still ended
up here, regrettably.

00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:57.280
JAKE: That is, I think
that goes back to what

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.990
we're saying about dumb luck.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.890
So many people, like I work
here at Google that sort of

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.190
prides itself with like
hiring the best people.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.090
I'm like--

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.884
SURMA: I'm not.

00:03:07.884 --> 00:03:09.940
JAKE: And I'm sitting
alongside people

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.500
who went to prestigious
universities,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.390
like Oxford, Cambridge types.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.370
And that does make me
feel like it's the--

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.370
oh, what do you call it?

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.412
SURMA: Imposter syndrome.

00:03:19.412 --> 00:03:21.320
JAKE: Imposter syndrome,
it gets that going.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.730
But then on the other
side, I'm like ha.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.450
You had to do a hard
university course.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.930
And I cheated.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.750
I got here somehow.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.220
SURMA: That's pretty much what
I think is worth pointing out,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.570
that especially web developments
or a lot of software

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.050
engineering is so
internet-centric that you can

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.980
find anything you want on the
internet and teach yourself,

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.150
if you want to.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.700
Like the formal
degrees are good.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.380
I don't want to say that
studying computer sciences

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.580
wasn't useful.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.040
Like, I learned things.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.830
Definitely.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.970
Things that I'm not necessarily
using nowadays in the web job

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.480
that I have.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.410
JAKE: Are you sure?

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.770
SURMA: Not often.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.170
There's some things I am using.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.040
JAKE: So when we--

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.100
I think we talked
about it before,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.800
that you're much better at
the low level stuff than I am.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.610
And I put that down to like
you did a lower level course,

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.670
that you did a course like what
compilers were involved in.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.910
And I did a course that
had VRML and Adobe Director

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.850
or it was Macromedia at the
time, I guess, and Flash.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.337
Like my course was
predominantly Flash.

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:31.170
SURMA: I mean, yeah.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.545
I did have a course
on compilers.

00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:35.320
But I think I know more low
level stuff because that's

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.330
what my first job was about.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.480
JAKE: Why did you pick to do a
computer science degree then?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.410
What was your--

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.640
SURMA: Because I
didn't know any better.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.820
Like it seems like
the obvious choice.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.617
I enjoyed maths.

00:04:48.617 --> 00:04:50.200
When I said, I enjoy
computer science,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.325
I want to do computer
science, you get people like,

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:53.622
do you know it's a lot of math.

00:04:53.622 --> 00:04:55.330
And I'm like, well,
I kind of enjoy maths

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.860
so I'm OK with that.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.040
And then I just studied
computer sciences.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.860
And I didn't enjoy
everything in there.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.660
Like some courses,
I did not enjoy.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.223
They were just really
outdated or not relevant

00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:08.890
to my interests.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.390
JAKE: So it's interesting.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.550
In my multimedia course, it
was the same story was true.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.410
It was predominantly Flash but
we did have some web courses.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.590
There were actually
courses that I--

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.740
I was always interested
in the computing side

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.230
that got you to something
visual really quickly.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.240
So like on my Amiga,
Deluxe Paint was my thing.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.698
I loved it, like
making animations.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:33.907
I thought I was going to be
a designer because that's

00:05:33.907 --> 00:05:35.053
what I really loved.

00:05:35.053 --> 00:05:36.470
There's a small
problem with that.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.360
I'm rubbish at it.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.410
Seriously bad at it.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.996
SURMA: Have you seen
our proc's intro?

00:05:40.996 --> 00:05:43.670
JAKE: The proc's
intro is beautiful.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.070
Don't mess with
the proc's intro.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.980
Yes.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.970
You see where things went wrong.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.448
So when I kind of went
on to the PC and the web,

00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:55.490
like the web was really--

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.820
I was like--

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.870
SURMA: I mean, that's
the shortest feedback

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.800
cycle you can have.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.310
Right?

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.390
Do a thing, see a thing.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.890
It's great.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.470
JAKE: And I was, I
want to make that.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.655
And then I found this
button called View Source.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.490
When I worked with executables
or used executable in the past,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.205
I couldn't figure
out how to get there.

00:06:15.205 --> 00:06:16.538
SURMA: And that's what drove me.

00:06:16.538 --> 00:06:18.470
Because when I asked,
whenever somebody said,

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.990
he is a programmer, I was like,
how do I make you exe files.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.040
That drove me.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.360
Because I wanted to understand.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.720
Because what I did, I opened
the exe files in Notepad

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.600
and changed the
strings that I saw.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.000
And sometimes it would still
run and sometimes it wouldn't.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.930
And only later I
figured out, it only

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.270
kept working if the string
was the exact same length as

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.900
before.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.990
JAKE: Yes.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.490
Nice.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.792
Yes.

00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:47.084
So this is the thing, I guess
the difference between me

00:06:47.084 --> 00:06:49.130
and you, is you looked
at the exe file and went,

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.280
I'm going to do that.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.790
Whereas, I went,
I can't know this.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.780
This is impossible.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.643
I can do it now.

00:06:54.643 --> 00:06:56.060
But at the time,
I was like, nope.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.935
And then the web just
gave me the easy answer

00:06:57.935 --> 00:06:59.570
to how this is done.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.040
SURMA: It took
surprisingly long.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.585
Because the people I asked
were trying to give--

00:07:04.585 --> 00:07:05.710
I guess I was fairly young.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.462
I must have been
like 10 or something

00:07:07.462 --> 00:07:08.670
when I was trying to do this.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.960
And when I had like,
how do I make exe,

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.408
and they were trying to give
me, oh, no, don't do that.

00:07:14.408 --> 00:07:15.200
Here's programming.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.070
Use Excel.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.220
And I'm like, that's
not programming.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.000
I mean, I know what
they were getting at.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.330
It's reactive programming.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.090
And you do formulas.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.645
But I want the exe files.

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:25.370
JAKE: Yes.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.920
I always thought for me
that it was the exe file

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.220
and screensaver, which are kind
of pretty much the same thing I

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.830
later learned, that
was like, there's

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.630
magic behind those files.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.840
On the file editing
thing, the closest I

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:45.970
got to that was Grand Theft Auto
I, that we found the wav files

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.940
for the cut sequences,
which would always

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.450
be this like amazing artwork
of like some serious gangster.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.080
And me and my friends would
just record, like, hello.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.730
Reginald here.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.760
I've been shooting
some people up.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.205
But I'm done now and I'm
going to go start a cake shot.

00:08:04.205 --> 00:08:06.830
SURMA: I think Grand Theft Auto
I was the one where I also went

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.310
in and found some .ini
files, where you can just go

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.930
in and then they're
pretty human readable.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.263
And then it's stuff
like, debug mode.

00:08:15.263 --> 00:08:16.430
And I was like, yes, please.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.290
JAKE: So I think
what we're coming

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.660
to is hacking around was
really sort of the entry point.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.470
SURMA: It seems it's always
a weird kind of passion

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.370
or interest that drives
you to just dig deeper.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.640
Because otherwise I wouldn't
have canceled on my friends

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.490
and stayed at home to keep
working on something stupid.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.799
JAKE: I mean, meaningful
order has gone completely

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.549
from this episode.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.620
So I'm going to jump
back to education.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.240
We learned how to-- one module
that we had was making website

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.547
without using Dreamweaver
or something like that,

00:08:49.547 --> 00:08:50.630
which was actually useful.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.910
Because I had never
tried that before.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.960
And we also did one
module on CSS Zen Garden.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.100
Do you know what that is?

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.370
SURMA: I've heard of it.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.260
I don't think I've ever used it.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.718
But I roughly know
what it's about.

00:09:01.718 --> 00:09:04.190
JAKE: It was kind of
dawn of CSS becoming

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.820
the right way of doing things.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.577
And it was an HTML page.

00:09:07.577 --> 00:09:09.410
And you were only allowed
to change the CSS.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.990
And it was essentially an art
gallery of different things

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.260
people could create by only
changing the CSS for the pages,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:15.950
by Dave Shea.

00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:20.540
And I thought it was actually
quite a modern thing for us

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.920
to do that at university.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.440
But I met Dave Shea later on.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.380
And I was like, we did a
module on you at university.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.540
It was a weird moment.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.260
But I would say it's like
a lot of the course was--

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.790
depending on the teacher--
a lot of it was out of date.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.790
I remember a question on my
exam paper which was about CSS.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.130
It said like, what
does this CSS do.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.447
And it had a.active color red.

00:09:47.447 --> 00:09:49.280
SURMA: That should be
a colon, shouldn't it?

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.020
JAKE: Should be a
colon, shouldn't it?

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.190
And so the person who marked
that must've hated me.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.660
Because I wrote two answers.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.160
And I was like, one
of these answers

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.630
is the answer you think.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.217
Because I just was
so obsessed for--

00:10:03.217 --> 00:10:05.800
SURMA: You're lookingfor a link
tag with an active class on it

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.065
or you meant to say--

00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:09.950
JAKE: Oh, maybe you
meant to say this.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:15.200
And the teacher was just like,
is it illegal to punch people?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.420
Because I had done a bit
of web stuff on the side.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.570
So I felt really smug.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.780
SURMA: If you can outsmart the
professor, then that's winning.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.288
JAKE: But for me, the most
important part of my course

00:10:26.288 --> 00:10:27.330
was the year in industry.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.990
It was a four year course and
in the middle, work experience.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.310
SURMA: I didn't have.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.440
JAKE: That's why
you're rubbish, mate.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.520
SURMA: Well, I did that myself.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.530
Because in my second
year, I think,

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.020
I tried to do my own
company with a couple

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.278
of other students.

00:10:44.278 --> 00:10:45.570
JAKE: Oh, yes, you did do that.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.112
SURMA: I did.

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:48.237
And that's how I got into
the whole low level stuff

00:10:48.237 --> 00:10:50.400
where I did microprocessor
programming and hardware

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.590
engineering and all these
things from the very

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.260
basic electrical
engineering knowledge

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.790
that I had, mostly
taught from my mom who

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.920
was an electrical engineer.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.270
JAKE: I didn't have that.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.912
My dad played guitar.

00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:02.870
Did he teach me guitar?

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.750
Dad, teach me guitar.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.708
No, you're left handed.

00:11:07.413 --> 00:11:08.580
Not stringing this up again.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.955
Actually, he was
very supportive.

00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:11.867
I just wasn't cool enough.

00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:12.950
Didn't have the dexterity.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.210
SURMA: So, yeah, that's
where I picked that up.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.700
And my company failed miserably.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.403
It was absolutely not a
success after two years

00:11:20.403 --> 00:11:22.570
of working full time and
not paying myself anything.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.800
So I do recommend--

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.320
JAKE: But did you learn from it?

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.570
SURMA: That's what I was like.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.680
I would never do it again.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.490
But I also would not skip it.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.320
Because I got all my
contacts during that.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.540
I learned so much about what I
want to do and what I'm good at

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.610
and what I'm not good at.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.410
I'm not good at
being a CEO because I

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:45.060
spend all my time doing
legal and taxes and like no.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.090
That's not what I'm good at.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.940
JAKE: I know I'm taking this
episode in random directions

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.060
again.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.737
Did you have to--

00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:55.320
it's fair to say
like we were talking,

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.460
we've got a lot of luck.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.830
There's also a lot
of people who have

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.830
had to have to overcome
a lot of stuff to make it

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.442
or to just like survive
in the industry.

00:12:07.442 --> 00:12:08.900
Did you get anything
close to that?

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.733
Was there anything that
you had to overcome?

00:12:10.733 --> 00:12:14.180
SURMA: I had massive,
lots of privileges

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.070
along the path that made it
very easy to end up where I am.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.210
Considering that
my dad is a doctor

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.920
who was one of the first
doctors to adopt a computer

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.360
system for his patients instead
of having a paper file system.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.570
And for some reason, so he had
a computer at home which was not

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.530
the norm in the mid
'90s necessarily,

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.830
I would say, like a
proper Windows 3.11.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.070
Good times.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.536
I mean, I wouldn't do anything
related to coding on there.

00:12:42.536 --> 00:12:45.036
I would just sit there and not
be afraid to touch a computer

00:12:45.036 --> 00:12:49.870
and just open up Paint and
draw because that's what I do.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.920
But yeah, he allowed
me to use a computer.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.020
And I bricked it more than once.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.210
He still allowed me to
use it, despite this

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.400
being his work computer with
his patients' data on there.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.560
And so that's obviously
a massive head start

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.370
to many other people who did
not have a computer at home

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.650
at age six or seven.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.040
JAKE: See, I did.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.570
So my family weren't
particularly well off.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.340
I don't know if I'd
say we were poor.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.750
But we weren't well-off either.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.930
But it was definitely
when my sister

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.760
arrived that my dad went,
well, what we're going

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.490
to do about this other child.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.210
Get him a computer.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.660
So I got ZX Spectrum
81, a Sinclair Spectrum.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.180
And that was kind of like--

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.810
and when I saw--

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.300
because obviously,
my dad was thinking

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.390
two things, like we'll
get the boy computer,

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.913
was also thinking we'll
get the boy a computer.

00:13:41.913 --> 00:13:43.580
And he did a bit of
programming on that.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.920
And I found that
almost more interesting

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.560
than the games
that came with it.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.400
But because I tended to be
on the generation of machine

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.720
behind the kind of
people that were richer,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.860
I sort of felt like I was
trying to get the most out

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.030
of the system.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.650
And that led to a
lot of like hacking.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.460
That had a lot of--

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.350
SURMA: Hashtag perfmatters.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.990
JAKE: Perfmatters, yeah.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.865
Right from the start.

00:14:06.865 --> 00:14:07.642
That was it.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.720
I was really interested
in the demo scene.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.762
I was never really on it.

00:14:12.762 --> 00:14:15.220
But like I was really
fascinated by like people who

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.530
are really driving computers.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.450
SURMA: So would
you say that that's

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.310
what made you go into
programming, that you

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.290
saw your dad do a little
bit of coding there?

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.840
JAKE: Yeah.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.340
Yeah.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.007
SURMA: Because for
me, it was my cousin.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.140
I was good with computers.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:28.760
I knew my way around them.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.320
I was comfortable with them.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.460
But I didn't do programming.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.460
And I hadn't any interest.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.580
I didn't know what it was.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.800
Then I saw him write a batch
script, like Windows batch

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.870
scripts, that would just
output stars and two spaces

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.760
as far fast as possible.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.010
And so it would look like
snow falling in the terminal

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.510
because [INAUDIBLE] going down.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.600
And I took that script
and I turned the stars

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.317
into a backslash.

00:14:51.317 --> 00:14:52.150
And now it was rain.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.280
And I was like, I am a hacker.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.020
JAKE: I was the
star of my school

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.280
because I could write on the
screen, Mr. Butler has farted

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.950
one time, has farted two times,
reset, and make that go down

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:04.950
that go down the screen.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.950
And everyone thought that
I was the funniest kid

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.570
in the classroom.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.445
I coded the machine.

00:15:09.445 --> 00:15:11.070
SURMA: You're not
that different today.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:11.570
JAKE: No.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.540
I still do that trick.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.070
It's just the name
at the start changes.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.890
But there was one
teacher I had at school,

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.970
he was a science teacher who,
I guess, didn't like children.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.300
He definitely didn't
like being in the north.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.310
Because I was doing
like computer stuff.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:33.590
And I think I was
probably being annoying.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.090
Trying to search
for the right word,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.780
let's say annoying,
severely annoying.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.110
And he sort of took
me aside at one point.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.380
and he kind of went, you
think you're pretty smart.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.130
You think you're pretty
smart at computers and stuff.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.250
But compared to kids in
the south, you're nothing.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.470
Yeah.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.970
Yeah.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:50.678
SURMA: All right.

00:15:50.678 --> 00:15:54.290
JAKE: And so that is probably
the only time in my career

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.180
that I kind of really
like felt that.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.030
And so when people talk about,
I guess, especially women

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.700
in the industry,
minorities who are getting

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.140
that like every day, that
moment that happened to me

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.260
is the one thing that I can
hang onto and think, god,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.610
how that made me feel,
I would not make it.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.500
I would not make it
if that was constant.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.283
So it's horrible
that it happens.

00:16:22.283 --> 00:16:23.700
And that's the
only thing I've got

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.250
that I can get some empathy.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.350
I could just expand,
multiply that by millions.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.930
SURMA: Yeah, pretty
much, isn't it?

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.760
So what is the bottom line?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.140
I mean, there's so many people
that I work with, we work with,

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.090
that come from completely
different fields

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.200
and will put us in a
corner in the things

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.823
that they can do that I
hope more companies adopt

00:16:47.823 --> 00:16:49.490
the whole you don't
need a degree to get

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.030
hired as a web engineer, or
something along those lines.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.850
Because they're missing out
on some very, very good talent

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.257
out there.

00:16:58.257 --> 00:17:00.590
And the other way around,
nobody should feel discouraged

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.215
from getting started
in web development

00:17:02.215 --> 00:17:04.700
just because they
come from an orchestra

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.720
background or something.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.849
Like it actually might
have some nice synergies

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:08.780
that you're not aware of yet.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.363
JAKE: Anyone could
be a web developer,

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.309
as long as you're
extremely lucky

00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:16.280
and are in the right
place at the right time.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.220
That's our moral.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.676
SURMA: That's bleak.

00:17:19.676 --> 00:17:21.950
JAKE: I guess it's like,
don't be discouraged.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.329
But don't also feel you have to
copy someone else's footsteps.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:29.870
Because when someone tells
you, here's how I made it,

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.880
they are almost certainly
completely wrong.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.420
They made it through some
other things, some luck.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.800
And if anyone watching
this is trying

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.663
to make it in the
industrry, then

00:17:41.663 --> 00:17:42.830
hope you have the same luck.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:43.580
SURMA: Keep going.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.830
JAKE: Keep going.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:51.440
HTTP203 swag, it's just a button
that goes, so, so, so, so, so.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.460
Just get like a full keyboard
with different pitches,

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.480
so, so, so, so, so, so,
so, so, so, so, so, so.
