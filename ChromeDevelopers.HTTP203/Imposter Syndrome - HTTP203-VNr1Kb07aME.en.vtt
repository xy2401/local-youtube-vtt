00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.370
SPEAKER 1: Imposter syndrome.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.960
SPEAKER 2: Yeah,
which is something

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.400
I think in our field of
work is talked about a lot,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.440
it's brought up a lot, like, ah,
everybody around me is so good

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.932
and I feel like I'm
not actually that good.

00:00:12.932 --> 00:00:15.390
Like you just said, like, you
say my low level knowledge is

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.765
better than yours,
but then again

00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:19.770
I basically dropped out
of my Master's and I feel

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.340
like I failed that, as well.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.840
So--

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.990
SPEAKER 1: Well, you did
a master's, though, right.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.490
I didn't.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.030
I didn't.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.610
SPEAKER 2: No, I didn't.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.820
I did my bachelors, and
dropped out of a master's.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.190
SPEAKER 1: OK, but
any master's you did

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.682
is more master's than I did.

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:33.574
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:39.260
SPEAKER 2: I think I saw
you tweeting about this

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.200
and I was agreeing
with you a lot,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.120
because you said there's
like a certain sense

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.090
that we talk about
it almost too much.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.270
SPEAKER 1: Well, I feel
like it's a lot of--

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.360
it feels like people are
using it as a positive trait.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.580
And I used to do the
same, like thinking, well,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.230
it's a whole form
of modesty, right?

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.010
So you're saying like, I don't
feel good enough to be here.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.220
You know, and maybe in some
ways other people seeing

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.370
that will go, oh, well, if that
person doesn't feel like they

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.620
deserve to be here, then I--

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.480
my feelings are
maybe fake, as well.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.874
Maybe it's this
imposter syndrome thing.

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:15.290
But the thing that
got me thinking

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.110
is that if you
have that mindset,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.832
and you encounter someone who--
may be whoever, they're new,

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:22.540
or their skills are
just in another area,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.380
but they're struggling
with a particular thing,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.750
I worry that if you kind of
really dig into that mindset

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.180
that you don't belong
when you see someone

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.010
who you could
subjectively sort of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.560
say they know less than I do.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.025
Then ergo, they deserve
even less to be here.

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:36.650
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.260
SPEAKER 1: You know
and that kind of--

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.301
SPEAKER 2: With that
mindset you can put yourself

00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:41.229
in a spot where you
actually will end up

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.520
not being encouraging for
someone who is just learning.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.480
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.640
Because the bad part
is it comes with,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.437
"and I don't
deserve to be here."

00:01:48.437 --> 00:01:51.020
It was a thread that went around
on Twitter, like a few months

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.960
ago now, I think, but
it was people saying,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.190
hi, I have this high position
of authority, or this job,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.950
and I can't do
something that might

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.460
be relatively basic to some.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.910
And I actually I
felt that thread

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.310
had all of the benefits of,
like, so other people can say,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.420
oh, well, maybe I should stop
worrying about what I know,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.484
because--

00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:14.900
but it didn't have that, "and
I don't deserve to be here."

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.983
SPEAKER 2: That's the bit.

00:02:15.983 --> 00:02:18.110
It's not-- it
shouldn't be up to you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.510
to decide if you deserve
to be at your workplace.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.630
That's what the interview
process is for, that's

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.136
what your colleagues are for.

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:27.210
And I'm very grateful
that I have colleagues

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.700
who keep encouraging me and
all their other colleagues

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.430
that everybody is here
with a good reason

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.674
and has the right skill and--

00:02:33.674 --> 00:02:34.590
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.420
SPEAKER 2: --and
since I keep learning

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.590
from basically all my
colleagues, everything is fine.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.505
I think if we just stop
deducing ourselves,

00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:45.130
well, we don't deserve
to be somewhere,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.140
we'll be in a better
place mentally already.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.056
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:02:48.056 --> 00:02:50.560
And I think, yeah,
especially if you genuinely

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.260
don't think you belong, there's
definitely an encouragement

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.760
to kind of close yourself in.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.860
To not be found out.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.910
And not talk openly.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.400
But on that Twitter
thread, what I

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.262
said was, like I use NDN
to look up APIs I designed.

00:03:05.262 --> 00:03:07.720
SPEAKER 2: Oh, are you one of
the service worker designers.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.030
SPEAKER 1: Oh, I don't
know if you know.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.700
But someone replied to me,
went, does that actually

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.160
more mean that your
APIs are badly designed?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.910
No.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.920
It means I have the
memory of a human being,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.320
like there's only so
much I can remember.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.340
And especially if I
know I can look it up.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.670
Because I have this worry
that if I have a finite amount

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.800
of space in my brain, right?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.800
And if I push too much stuff in,
something else will fall out.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.010
So like if I learn how
to do pointers in C,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.102
then that might push out how
to breathe, or something.

00:03:46.102 --> 00:03:48.310
SPEAKER 2: Many people have
died from just forgetting

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.570
to breathe in the past.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.270
SPEAKER 1: C has
killed many people.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.820
Learning C has
destroyed many lives.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.059
But if I can look
it up easily then--

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:59.850
SPEAKER 2: And I think
that that's actually

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.430
really a good trait.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.300
It's something that I
always thought about.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.190
It could be like it you try to
minimize the amount that you

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.560
actually have to keep in
your head and delegate things

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.340
out to the things you can either
look up, or you can deduce.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.840
Which is very
mathematical actually,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.284
where you just
remember the axioms

00:04:14.284 --> 00:04:15.700
and from there you
can go anywhere

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.060
you want in terms of knowledge.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.640
If you really need to
learn something by heart,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.514
it will happen automatically
because you have

00:04:20.514 --> 00:04:21.820
to use it over and over anyway.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.195
SPEAKER 1: Through real usage,
not just kind of because--

00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:27.280
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, because I
keep using Flexbox, I now know

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.480
all the Flexbox properties.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.780
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.400
SPEAKER 2: I didn't sit
down and memorize them.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.360
SPEAKER 1: Hang on.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.240
Justify is the horizontal
one, if it's a row,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.820
and a line item is the vertical?

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.320
SPEAKER 2: Here's
how I remember it.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.044
You know how in Word or any
kind of text processing,

00:04:45.044 --> 00:04:46.210
you have the justify button.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.075
It's left justified,
right justified.

00:04:48.075 --> 00:04:48.700
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.530
SPEAKER 2: So that
basically makes

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.830
text that flows just to
the right or to the left.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.120
And Flexbox has--

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.110
SPEAKER 1: No way.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.821
That's amazing.

00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:58.320
Right.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.150
OK.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.370
So, justify is the
horizontal one, it's a row.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.760
SPEAKER 2: And it moves the
elements in inline direction.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.337
SPEAKER 1: That's amazing.

00:05:07.337 --> 00:05:09.170
SPEAKER 2: And the align
is for the actual--

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.295
SPEAKER 1: We don't actually
need to film any more.

00:05:11.295 --> 00:05:12.650
Like that-- that is--

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.810
the one, you know what?

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.116
You can stay.

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:17.990
SPEAKER 2: I made it!

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.370
SPEAKER 1: Based on that.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.850
That's a piece of
knowledge I have failed

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.470
to grasp my entire career.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.170
And I remember it
now because of that.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.325
SPEAKER 2: Because
of the Word buttons.

00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:29.720
SPEAKER 1: Because, yeah.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.330
SPEAKER 2: When I
learned English,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.750
I had often heard this
phrase, A for effort.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.470
But I also often heard
people spelling their names

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.350
with like the NATO radio alpha.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.060
They say, S for Sierra.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.782
And for November.

00:05:41.782 --> 00:05:42.490
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.430
SPEAKER 2: And I was
like, A for effort?
