00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.240
SPEAKER 1: I think, at
first, it's always, actually,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.247
who are you and why?

00:00:05.247 --> 00:00:06.080
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.976
That's good.

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:07.725
SPEAKER 2: Oh, OK.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:08.200
ERIC BIDELMAN: No, please.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.290
SPEAKER 2: I'm
[? Venam Rada, ?] affectionately

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.800
known as V, like the movie.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.050
SPEAKER 1: It's easier to say.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.716
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:14.646
Also "V for Vendetta."

00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:15.396
ERIC BIDELMAN: Oh.

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:16.170
SPEAKER 3: Oh.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.010
SPEAKER 1: That's a good
name for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.670
SPEAKER 2: Power play.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.170
No.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.620
But yeah.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.760
I'm a product manager in the
Chrome App platform team.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.245
Work on Lighthouse,
Speed Metrics.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:27.775
Just trying to, you
know, make the web fast.

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:28.650
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.170
That's good.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.270
ERIC BIDELMAN: Nice.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.400
And I'm Eric Bidelman.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.650
I actually work with you guys.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.034
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:33.034 --> 00:00:35.200
SPEAKER 3: Everyone we've
interviewed, we work with.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.140
You don't need to say that.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.496
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:38.070
ERIC BIDELMAN: Just trying
to make everything clear.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.720
SPEAKER 3: Look, there's a
certain amount of, you know,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.370
theater here.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.203
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:00:42.203 --> 00:00:44.370
SPEAKER 3: We're sort of
pretending we don't know

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.510
all of the content already.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.138
Also, have you ever
done video before?

00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:47.638
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:47.638 --> 00:00:48.126
ERIC BIDELMAN: No.

00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:49.459
SPEAKER 3: This is how it works.

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:53.006
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:57.650
SPEAKER 1: So you have
this really lame thing

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.090
that you developed
and that you PM.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.570
What is it?

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.450
SPEAKER 3: Yeah,
what's Lighthouse?

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.890
What does it do?

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.100
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.030
Talk about it.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.660
Go.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.370
SPEAKER 2: Sure.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.161
I can--

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:04.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.410
ERIC BIDELMAN: It's
your product, V.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.076
SPEAKER 2: Sure.

00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:08.930
So Lighthouse is
a developer tool.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.890
Anyone can run it.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.020
And it basically gives
you a personalized report

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.800
over your website across
five different categories--

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.430
progressive web
app, performance,

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.999
accessibility, developer
best practices, and SEO.

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:20.540
SPEAKER 1: You've
got that memorized.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.290
That's pretty bad.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.165
That's pretty badass.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:23.240
SPEAKER 2: I'm a PM.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.544
I pitch this every day.

00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:26.210
SPEAKER 1: I would
have been able to say

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.940
progressive and
accessibility, and then I

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.210
was like, wow,
that's all I know.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.210
SPEAKER 3: So who would
run this and when?

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.854
What's the--

00:01:33.854 --> 00:01:34.520
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.220
So we really think it's
for any developer that's

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.280
building a website.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.660
And we think it's really
helpful because, you know,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.177
there's so much advice
that Google and other blogs

00:01:44.177 --> 00:01:46.010
give out, in terms of,
what are you supposed

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.259
to do to build a good website?

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.340
And our mission is really
to try to consolidate

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.810
all that together in one place.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.072
So you can just run one tool.

00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:53.780
It tells you exactly
what you need to do,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.830
and then you're just done.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.150
SPEAKER 1: And we have it
in DevTools now, right?

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.640
SPEAKER 2: Yes, we do.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.150
You can run it on
the Audits panel.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.500
SPEAKER 1: The Audits panel.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.330
ERIC BIDELMAN: One could say
it's a guiding light for web

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.810
developers to follow.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.735
SPEAKER 1: Oh, wow.

00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:05.715
Look how the metaphor works out.

00:02:05.715 --> 00:02:06.260
ERIC BIDELMAN: See
what I did there?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.551
I'll be dropping those all day.

00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:08.717
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:10.800
SPEAKER 3: So give an
example of one of the things

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.370
that Lighthouse is going to tell
me I'm doing right or wrong.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.940
What's the--

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.630
SPEAKER 2: Sure.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.330
So for example, in the
performance section,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.024
it can tell you if you've
optimized your images properly,

00:02:20.024 --> 00:02:20.690
if you need to--

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.950
SPEAKER 1: Which
lots of people don't.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:22.610
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.530
It's a very easy
win that you can

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.360
get-- that you can do
in order to improve

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.650
the site of your performance.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.430
With PWA, it can
tell you if you have

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.779
a service worker installed,
errors in your manifest files.

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:33.820
SPEAKER 1: Jake is happy.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.140
SPEAKER 3: Well, what I
actually want is, can we--

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.940
you know how, when
anyone mentions Intel,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.390
it has to cut to
the little logo--

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.314
[VOCALIZING]

00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:43.480
What do we have to do to
get one for Service Worker?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.396
SPEAKER 1: Where your
face shows up and goes--

00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:46.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.850
SPEAKER 3: As it zooms
towards the camera.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.380
Yeah.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.380
Can we make that happen?

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.310
Can we do that in post?

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.226
We'll do that in post.

00:02:55.557 --> 00:02:56.390
SPEAKER 2: But yeah.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.510
I mean, there's a whole bunch
of things Lighthouse can tell

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.220
you-- performance, images,
amongst many other things--

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.410
PWA, service workers.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.000
SPEAKER 1: So we
are out of jobs,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.980
basically, is what
you're telling us.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.830
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, that's true.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.490
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.990
Yes.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.410
That was the goal
all along, actually.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.010
SPEAKER 1: That hurt.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.340
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.480
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.130
SPEAKER 2: Our key success
metric is, do Surmat and Jake

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.630
have a job?

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.030
No.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.954
Yes, success rate.

00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:17.620
SPEAKER 1: .com.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.406
Do Surmat and Jake
still have a job .com.

00:03:20.406 --> 00:03:22.280
SPEAKER 3: So wait, what
would we do instead?

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.231
What is our backup?

00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.022
SPEAKER 1: Well, I
have [INAUDIBLE],, mate.

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:25.762
[SIGHS]

00:03:25.762 --> 00:03:26.595
SPEAKER 3: Oh, yeah.

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:27.870
And now the Service
Worker thing's done.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.150
ERIC BIDELMAN: What's
next after Service Worker?

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.160
Everybody's shipping now?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.410
SPEAKER 3: We do
background fact check.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.680
I've got stuff on
the backburner.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.980
ERIC BIDELMAN: All right.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.680
There's peripheral APIs.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.040
All right.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.300
SPEAKER 3: I might be OK.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.150
OK.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.400
But you know, solving
people's performance problems.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.400
Is it doing-- is it load
time performance, is it

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.080
runtime performance, or both?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.090
SPEAKER 2: I think
our goal is both.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.880
Ultimately, we want to be
the most comprehensive tool

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.540
possible.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.998
And we actually
added a whole bunch

00:03:48.998 --> 00:03:52.140
of new loading-focused
audits this year.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.374
There's a talk that Addie and
Eva gave at I/O this year,

00:03:55.374 --> 00:03:56.540
so if you're interested in--

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.050
SPEAKER 1: Talking to her later.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.480
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.290
SPEAKER 1: She's going to
tell us more about that.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.360
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.660
So you can learn more from her.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.900
SPEAKER 3: Yeah.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.650
Don't [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.196
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:03.820
SPEAKER 1: Yep.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.570
Already know that.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.770
Sorry.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.150
SPEAKER 3: So is Lighthouse
something that developers

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.800
are going to have to run
manually whenever they want,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.870
or is there something--

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.250
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.380
SPEAKER 3: --is there ways they
can put it in their tool chain?

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.670
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.960
Yes.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.790
So you can run it
manually through DevTools

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.740
as we talked about.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.170
There's also a standalone Chrome
extension and an npm module,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.949
for those of us who like running
things on the command line.

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.490
But actually, at
I/O this year, we're

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.812
announcing an API, which
people can use to automate--

00:04:29.812 --> 00:04:31.270
SPEAKER 1: Lighthouse
as a service.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.940
ERIC BIDELMAN:
Lighthouse as a service.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.326
SPEAKER 2: LaaS.

00:04:32.326 --> 00:04:33.100
ERIC BIDELMAN: Lassie.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.560
SPEAKER 1: Bam.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.518
SPEAKER 2: Like Lassie?

00:04:34.518 --> 00:04:35.900
Like the White House dog.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.680
ERIC BIDELMAN:
Yeah, like the dog.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.880
SPEAKER 1: Oh, I thought,
like, mango lassi.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.010
ERIC BIDELMAN: Oh, that, too.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.718
That's delicious.

00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:40.910
SPEAKER 2: That, too, yes.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.665
If you want to drink
it or adore it.

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:43.190
SPEAKER 1: You can put a
straw in the Lighthouse.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.920
ERIC BIDELMAN: With
Lassie as a service.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.421
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:45.711
SPEAKER 2: Lassie as a service.

00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:46.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.230
ERIC BIDELMAN: Drink up.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.160
SPEAKER 2: But yeah,
so you can use the API

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.122
and integrate it into
your CI workflow.

00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:53.330
There's actually-- one of
the partners we worked with

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.250
on the API, Duda--

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.050
actually named after the Dude
in "Big Lebowski," funny enough.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.300
SPEAKER 1: So many references.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.914
This is on fire.

00:05:00.914 --> 00:05:01.580
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.477
So Duda actually integrated
it into their Jenkins

00:05:04.477 --> 00:05:05.810
continuous integration pipeline.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.893
We're going to show off
that demo at I/O, as well.

00:05:07.893 --> 00:05:10.160
SPEAKER 1: So at the
state of the union,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.430
they said they're looking
into how they can--

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.455
instead of just, you use
AMP, therefore you get batch,

00:05:16.455 --> 00:05:19.020
they're like, you do
good in performance,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.489
therefore, you get a
good rating on search.

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:23.780
Does it mean that, if I get
a good score in Lighthouse,

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.900
I can be pretty confident that
I will do well in whatever they

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.950
come up with, as well?

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.616
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:05:28.616 --> 00:05:30.950
So the details of the exact
criteria, we're still--

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:31.290
SPEAKER 1: It's all in flux.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.780
SPEAKER 2: --working
on figuring out.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.280
Exactly.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.870
But what we're trying to do,
and make sure, with our criteria

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.017
is whatever metrics that we
tell developers to optimize for,

00:05:39.017 --> 00:05:40.850
that there is a way to
measure it in the lab

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.380
and there's a way to
measure it in the wild.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.210
SPEAKER 1: Well,
that sounds good.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.490
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.570
And then, in the
lab, obviously, we're

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.520
going to make sure that tools,
like Lighthouse, are exposing

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.490
those metrics, as well.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.710
So yes.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.437
Long answer to your question.

00:05:50.437 --> 00:05:51.020
SPEAKER 1: No.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.410
I mean, that's good.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.576
Because then it just means--

00:05:52.576 --> 00:05:54.934
you say you have an npm
module, we have it in DevTools.

00:05:54.934 --> 00:05:57.600
That means I can run it locally,
and then I can put it on my CI,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.210
as well.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.280
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.030
SPEAKER 1: And I can--

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.035
SPEAKER 2: You want to
test the public version--

00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:01.420
SPEAKER 1: Reject the PR if
somebody does stupid things.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.470
ERIC BIDELMAN: And you
can use the Lighthouse API

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.760
if you want to
run scale, and you

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.610
don't have to install anything,
and just get JSON results.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.160
SPEAKER 2: Don't have to
keep your own machines,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.530
try anything like that.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.120
SPEAKER 1: I could
do this for a living.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.790
ERIC BIDELMAN: You
basically could.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.331
SPEAKER 3: So how quickly do
the rules in Lighthouse develop?

00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:15.540
If I work really hard, get my
score of 100 on Lighthouse,

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.780
am I going to check back next
week, and it's going to be 50?

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.622
SPEAKER 2: So we try
to make sure things

00:06:20.622 --> 00:06:21.580
like this don't happen.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.120
But we also want to make
sure that it's comprehensive,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.810
and we keep up to date with
the current state of the union.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.340
So I don't have,
like, an exact, we

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.740
add one new audit every month.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.051
But we try to make sure that
we tackle different parts

00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:36.300
of the performance experience.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.160
So we've spent a ton
of time on performance,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.130
and we launched search engine
optimization audits this year.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.310
And our next focus is going to
be on user experience audits,

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.560
especially getting the forms.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.230
How do you make a really
good form experience, which

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.330
is really important
to a lot of folks who

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.577
have e-commerce stores, and they
want to convert a lot of users,

00:06:54.577 --> 00:06:55.410
make a lot of money.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.760
SPEAKER 1: Oh, that sounds good.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.760
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.430
We have the Perth sandbox
over at the sandbox area,

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.590
and people can come up
and try Lighthouse, right?

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.060
They can enter the
URL on the tool.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.350
SPEAKER 1: On the
actual Lighthouse.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.475
ERIC BIDELMAN: On the real
Lighthouse we have here.

00:07:06.475 --> 00:07:07.240
It's incredible.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.179
SPEAKER 3: This video is going
out after I/O, so you're not--

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:11.220
pitching that is useless.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.492
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:12.492 --> 00:07:13.200
This is not live.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.060
ERIC BIDELMAN: I've been very
pleased to see all the score.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.810
The accessibly scores
are actually pretty high.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.310
And SEO scores are
really high, too.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.250
So people care about
accessibility and SEO.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:20.790
SPEAKER 3: That's good to hear.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.730
ERIC BIDELMAN: Score 90-plus.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.920
So we're doing really well.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.420
SPEAKER 1: They're just testing
the same site over and over.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.100
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's true.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.798
Example.com.

00:07:25.798 --> 00:07:27.052
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:27.052 --> 00:07:28.374
SPEAKER 1: Doing well.

00:07:28.374 --> 00:07:29.790
So what have you
been doing, then?

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:30.623
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:07:30.623 --> 00:07:32.430
I've been working on
Puppeteer, and working

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.305
with Headless Chrome.

00:07:33.305 --> 00:07:35.742
I got really excited about
just controlling Chrome.

00:07:35.742 --> 00:07:36.450
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.380
That's two things.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:37.650
ERIC BIDELMAN: OK.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.580
Let's parse that out.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.050
SPEAKER 3: Yes.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.630
ERIC BIDELMAN: All right.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:40.000
Headless Chrome.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.180
So Headless Chrome, I
think we shipped it, maybe,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.470
Chrome 59 last year.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.410
Basically run Chrome
without a window, right?

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.620
Headless mode.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.015
Headful mode, headless mode.

00:07:49.015 --> 00:07:50.390
SPEAKER 1: So like
what Phantom--

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.600
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.130
SPEAKER 1: --used to be.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:51.800
Phantom JS.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.075
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:07:52.075 --> 00:07:52.760
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.796
So the cool thing about this is
it's Blink, it's Chrome, right?

00:07:55.796 --> 00:07:57.170
It stays up to
date with the web.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.420
So you no longer have to--

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.430
SPEAKER 1: I got the new APIs.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.975
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:59.975 --> 00:08:01.367
You can test Service Worker.

00:08:01.367 --> 00:08:01.950
You can test--

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:02.520
SPEAKER 3: Does
it stay up to date

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.760
with each version of Chrome?

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.330
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:04.980
SPEAKER 3: Oh, excellent.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.700
ERIC BIDELMAN: So
it's just Chrome,

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.075
but you throw on a command
line flag, dash-dash headless.

00:08:08.075 --> 00:08:09.866
And you don't see
Chrome, but you can still

00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:10.790
do everything it does.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.900
So it's kind of cool because
we can, yeah, finally

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.100
test service worker.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.620
We can write an app that uses
modules, and we can test that.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.780
SPEAKER 1: So how
do I control it?

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.580
If it's Chrome headless,
there's no window.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.960
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.607
So this is where
Puppeteer comes in.

00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:24.190
SPEAKER 3: Oh.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:24.840
SPEAKER 1: Oh.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.705
ERIC BIDELMAN: So Puppeteer
is a library that we created.

00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:27.710
It's a node library.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.251
You can get it off npm.

00:08:29.251 --> 00:08:30.750
It bundles Chrome,
so you don't have

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.640
to worry about getting
that or anything.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.190
And you can basically just
use these high-level APIs,

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.830
control Chrome, do everything
that DevTools can do.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:38.960
SPEAKER 1: Oh, so you're
using the Dev Tools

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.950
protocol under the hood?

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.390
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:40.620
Yeah.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.049
So the protocol is crazy big,
as you guys probably know,

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:44.514
and it's very complex.

00:08:44.514 --> 00:08:45.930
There's a lot of
stuff you can do.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.850
It's not immediately obvious
how to put things together

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.426
sometimes.

00:08:48.426 --> 00:08:49.800
SPEAKER 3: Can
you do multi-touch

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.717
through the protocol?

00:08:50.717 --> 00:08:52.050
ERIC BIDELMAN: You can do touch.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.410
I think-- we are personally
working on multi-touch.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.020
SPEAKER 3: OK.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.920
ERIC BIDELMAN: We
have keyboard input,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.780
we have touch, barebone
stuff right now.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.040
But as the days go
on, the engineers

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.290
will add more stuff, for sure.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:02.773
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:09:02.773 --> 00:09:03.256
All right.

00:09:03.256 --> 00:09:03.740
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.220
But, yeah, anything DevTools
can do, you can do in Puppeteer.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.053
SPEAKER 3: That's really
important, as well.

00:09:08.053 --> 00:09:11.700
It's great to see having that
API to send out input events

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.637
exactly the way that it
would occur if the user--

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.470
SPEAKER 1: Because in
JavaScript, you can't.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.267
If you're like, dispatch
event yourself--

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:19.350
SPEAKER 3: It's different.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.520
SPEAKER 1: It's different.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.690
SPEAKER 3: It's
slightly different.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:21.960
ERIC BIDELMAN: Exactly.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.790
SPEAKER 1: Oh, it can
screw you over really bad.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.410
SPEAKER 3: Right, exactly.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.951
So that's why it's
so important to be

00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:27.540
doing this stuff for real.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.040
ERIC BIDELMAN: Well,
it's cool, too,

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.647
because DevTools has features
like emulation and code

00:09:31.647 --> 00:09:34.230
coverage, and all these really
powerful things they're adding.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.340
Now we can tap into that.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.770
And you can write scripts
that analyze your site

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.540
in a different way or something,
that DevTools might not

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.070
be able to do now.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.770
SPEAKER 1: I hadn't
even thought of that.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.310
Is coverage already
exposed in Puppeteer?

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.320
ERIC BIDELMAN: Coverage
is exposed in Puppeteer.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.280
Tracing's exposed.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.360
SPEAKER 1: Because that's
also good for a CI,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.270
where you're like, yo--

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.160
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.850
SPEAKER 1: --you
have unused CSS--

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:49.070
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.430
SPEAKER 1: --or
something, you know?

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.840
ERIC BIDELMAN: So I'm
showing some cool demos.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.610
Because I was like,
man, DevTools is cool,

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.460
but we can be even
cooler than the DevTools.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:55.870
SPEAKER 1: By the
way, we're totally

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.440
going to link to both of your
talks in the description.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:57.840
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.490
Nice.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.525
SPEAKER 1: So what is
the biggest upcoming

00:10:00.525 --> 00:10:02.400
thing in Puppeteer you're
looking forward to?

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.983
ERIC BIDELMAN: Biggest
upcoming thing.

00:10:03.983 --> 00:10:06.785
So we just-- we're working
on more touch stuff,

00:10:06.785 --> 00:10:08.910
just making sure the employee
APIs are really good.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.440
We're working on being able
to test your end-to-end kind

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.440
of PWA story.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.780
So does my app
fully work offline?

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.540
Am I missing something
from the cache?

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.314
Being able to do things like
turn on and off notifications,

00:10:22.314 --> 00:10:23.730
go through the
end-to-end stories.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.810
SPEAKER 1: So many
things I never thought

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:25.700
about they would be testing.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.350
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah, I know.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.540
Well, you can test your UI.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.450
You can test whatever you want.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:28.770
Yeah.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:28.860
SPEAKER 3: Yeah.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.160
Are notifications
part of that, as well,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.800
so you can actually access
headless notifications, too?

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.700
ERIC BIDELMAN: Eventually, yeah.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.155
SPEAKER 3: Oh, eventually, OK.

00:10:34.155 --> 00:10:34.440
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.860
So some of these, they need
to add different layers.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.340
And this would be at the
DevTools protocol layer.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.420
Screen casting is another
big feature request.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.378
People want to be able
to take videos of what's

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:45.510
going on on the screen.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.530
SPEAKER 1: So it's
headless, but it still

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.345
gets rendered to a video?

00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:47.670
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.360
It's-- you know.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.700
SPEAKER 3: It's just like,
Command-H, hide the window.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.820
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.790
SPEAKER 3: Is that how
you implemented it?

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:52.120
ERIC BIDELMAN: It's a trick.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.605
It's a trick.

00:10:52.605 --> 00:10:53.260
SPEAKER 3: Oh, excellent.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:53.870
SPEAKER 1: It's outsourced.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.287
Some person somewhere
goes, like--

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:55.786
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:55.786 --> 00:10:57.460
ERIC BIDELMAN: I think
on Mac, actually,

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.830
sometimes you actually see
the Chrome logo come up as it

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.560
starts to boot up
Chrome, but it's--

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:01.990
SPEAKER 3: And then it hides it.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.930
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah,
they're hiding it.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:03.610
SPEAKER 3: Oh.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.600
So what we're hearing
is massive hack.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.305
ERIC BIDELMAN: Massive hack.

00:11:06.305 --> 00:11:06.570
SPEAKER 3: Right.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.780
All that engineering work--

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.040
ERIC BIDELMAN: It's all
Chrome with it's beautiful--

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:09.940
SPEAKER 3: Old tricks.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.600
SPEAKER 1: From
experience, I can

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.340
say that the upset is used--

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.070
I used to set up testing
on Travis or whatever,

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.570
and then you'd have
this whole dance

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.439
of installing the x
framebuffer server,

00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:22.480
and starting Chrome with
that framebuffer device.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.855
And that's not
necessary anymore.

00:11:23.855 --> 00:11:26.027
You legit can just start
it without an actual UI.

00:11:26.027 --> 00:11:28.360
ERIC BIDELMAN: We were actually
doing that at Lighthouse

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.610
for a while, doing our
unit tests on Travis.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.140
And you had to
install that stuff.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.570
And instead, we-- as soon as
Headless Chrome comes around,

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.690
you can add that flag and
everything gets a lot easier.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.482
[MUMBLING]

00:11:39.482 --> 00:11:41.190
SPEAKER 3: Which order
are we doing this?

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.065
SPEAKER 1: [MUMBLING]

00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:43.157
SPEAKER 3: [MUMBLING]

00:11:43.157 --> 00:11:44.740
So did you want to
do this in English?

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.040
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:45.380
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.430
ERIC BIDELMAN: We'd
prefer it if we could.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.070
SPEAKER 3: Because we were going
to explain it in our own words.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.690
ERIC BIDELMAN: We'll catch on.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:50.330
We're fast learners.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:50.996
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:11:50.996 --> 00:11:52.180
SPEAKER 3: OK.
