MONICA DINCULESCU:
What is my personality?

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.723
SURMA: A-plus.

00:00:01.723 --> 00:00:02.510
That's an A-plus.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.700
JAKE: Yeah, your
personality is correct.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.130
Like, because that--

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.910
SURMA: Your
personality is correct!

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.540
MONICA DINCULESCU:
Oh, thank God.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.564
JAKE: Well done.

00:00:06.564 --> 00:00:06.588
It's not defective.

00:00:06.588 --> 00:00:07.968
You can keep it.

00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:09.967
It doesn't need to go
into the store for repair.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:13.783
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.207
Who are you and why?

00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:19.540
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yes, very
well, thank you for asking.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.550
I am Monica, and
because I can be.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.475
Somebody has to be,
so it can only be me.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:24.600
JAKE: That's a good answer.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.050
MONICA DINCULESCU: Thank you.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.700
SURMA: That went deep.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.420
What-- what do you talk about?

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.730
What is your plan for I/O?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.117
What sounds are you going
to make on stage here?

00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:34.450
MONICA DINCULESCU: Mouth sounds.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.080
SURMA: Mouth sounds?

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.380
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yes.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.940
JAKE: That's good, because
I tried a different way.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.685
It did not go well.

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:42.393
SURMA: Not a popular
session, I've heard.

00:00:42.393 --> 00:00:43.601
MONICA DINCULESCU: You would.

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:47.000
I am making mouth sounds
about the PWA starter kit.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.242
So my team has been building
this awesome bunch of templates

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:50.950
that you can use.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.670
And you can pick them up
and you can build a PWA.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.420
And we try to do most
of the heavy lifting

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.430
for you, so that you don't have.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.930
JAKE: Is this a
kind of similar tool

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.020
to like Yeoman or Preact CLI?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.880
Is that similar to
this sort of thing?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.150
SURMA: That was buzzword-y.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.635
Jesus.

00:01:04.635 --> 00:01:05.230
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yeah.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.813
So we looked at a
whole bunch of CLIs,

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:09.190
and we saw what they were
doing, and we tried to--

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.482
SURMA: And you deemed it wrong.

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:12.065
MONICA DINCULESCU:
Well, a lot of them

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:14.020
deal with starting
up with a framework,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.630
whereas starting out with a
PWA is a little bit different.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.000
Because what you're trying
to do is make like a fairly

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.261
framework-agnostic,
work-with-everything--

00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:22.760
SURMA: Yeah.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.801
MONICA DINCULESCU: --PWA.

00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.920
So ours tries to use
things off the shelf,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.560
so we have Redux for
state management.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.500
We didn't invent our own.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.322
We're using lit-elemental
HTML for the rendering.

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:34.780
JAKE: That sounds
like a framework.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.480
SURMA: Yeah.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.197
A little bit.

00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:37.530
MONICA DINCULESCU: It's like 2k.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.460
You find me a
framework that's 2k.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.367
It's not a framework.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.200
SURMA: So I've heard--
that's a Redux thing.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.919
Redux-- Redux?

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:43.960
MONICA DINCULESCU: Redux.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.140
SURMA: Redux.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.920
MONICA DINCULESCU: Redux?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.350
SURMA: I've heard
that word a lot.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.350
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yeah.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.320
SURMA: I still don't
know what it is.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.670
It's like Flux Redux
and React Redux.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.540
It's always in there, but
I don't know what it is.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.660
MONICA DINCULESCU: It's
a tiny state container.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.522
It's like a very
glorified key-value store.

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:03.730
And it has a whole bunch of
patterns, what you can do

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.080
and can't do with your data.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.600
The whole point being there
is one source of truth,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.360
only the store has
access to your data.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.860
SURMA: So that's the thing where
you connect your elements--

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.220
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yeah.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.480
SURMA: --and they get updates
when something changes.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yeah.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.750
An element can care about
data getting updated,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.820
or wants to
communicate that data

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.590
needs to be updated, but can
never just poke at the data,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.465
because that's gross.

00:02:22.465 --> 00:02:24.945
JAKE: But I thought that
was a react thing, right?

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:25.861
MONICA DINCULESCU: No.

00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:31.520
Redux is a framework-agnostic,
view-independent thingamajig.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.120
SURMA: You've practiced this.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120
MONICA DINCULESCU: I do.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.870
I have a slide.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.131
I have it in the
palace of my mind.

00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:37.630
JAKE: OK.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.790
So yeah.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.130
So it can work with
any framework--

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.730
MONICA DINCULESCU:
Yeah, which is

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.120
why it's really popular,
because you can just

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.920
jam it into anything.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.410
And a whole bunch of frameworks
have like little adapters,

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.618
so that it makes it easier
inside of their framework.

00:02:46.618 --> 00:02:48.929
But you can just use vanilla
Redux with no problems.

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.220
JAKE: You sort of-- you threw
down, like, lit-element--

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.261
MONICA DINCULESCU: I did.

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:53.428
JAKE: --like that's a thing.

00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:55.469
MONICA DINCULESCU: You
haven't heard of it, Jake?

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:56.460
God.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.940
It's already,
like, two days old.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.470
JAKE: I'm so far behind.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.970
MONICA DINCULESCU:
Yes, so, lit-html

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.540
is a tiny little library
that Justin wrote last year.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.114
And it basically lets
you render templates--

00:03:06.114 --> 00:03:07.480
HTML templates-- in JavaScript.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.010
And it's super fast
because it's super optimal

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.720
about how it re-renders
them and stuff like that.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.428
And lit-element--

00:03:11.428 --> 00:03:14.250
SURMA: It's like they did the
little value bindings thingy,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.920
right?

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.310
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yeah.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.810
And lit-element
does the same thing,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.450
where we took lit-html and took
all of that rendering logic

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.660
and put it in a custom
element base class.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.870
So it has things that
you're familiar with.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.360
It has a render method, so
that that gets called when

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.780
your properties get updated.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.630
And whatever you put
in your render method

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.421
is basically magic
because it's JavaScript.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.470
You can go to town
if you want to.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.680
And other tiny little
helpers, like lifecycle

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.780
helpers, that you might
need in a custom element.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.780
SURMA: I mean, that seems like--
what I know from [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.660
is like it's almost individual,
tiny, little helpers that

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.060
will use everything-- buy
everything all at once.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.780
It seems like something that
your team is doing well.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.250
MONICA DINCULESCU:
And now we can get rid

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.680
of a lot of what
Polymer 1 used to have,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.434
because four browsers
almost have custom elements.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.350
JAKE: So what is the
status, in terms of that?

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.226
Because, I'd just like to say,
my project, Service Worker,

00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:00.600
has just shipped
in all browsers.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.500
So where are we
with your project?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.970
MONICA DINCULESCU: Is that
all you've been doing?

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.520
JAKE: Oh, yeah.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.020
OK.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.676
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:06.550
I-11 doesn't have it.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.091
MONICA DINCULESCU:
So we have Chrome.

00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:08.840
We have Safari.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.340
JAKE: Good.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.600
MONICA DINCULESCU: We
have custom elements

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.770
and Firefox behind a flag.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.870
And I've heard Shadow
DOM is very close.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.390
JAKE: Oh.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.890
OK.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:15.575
SURMA: Rumors!

00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:17.200
MONICA DINCULESCU:
And that is the end.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.980
SURMA: Good ones, though.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.170
MONICA DINCULESCU: I mean--
and probably Opera and--

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.839
JAKE: Oh, because-- yeah.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.120
SURMA: Opera--

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.806
JAKE: All the Chrome.

00:04:21.806 --> 00:04:22.150
MONICA DINCULESCU:
Yeah, all the Chrome.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.136
SURMA: Yeah.

00:04:23.136 --> 00:04:24.760
MONICA DINCULESCU:
We do not have Edge.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.370
We have interest from Edge, but
not implementation from Edge.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.119
JAKE: What's the state
of polyfills, then,

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:30.890
if people wanted to
use your stuff today?

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.140
MONICA DINCULESCU: They exist.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.330
JAKE: Good.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.695
SURMA: They've existed
for a long time.

00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:34.140
A month.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.240
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yeah.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.520
So polyfills have
existed for a long time.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.020
We've updated the polyfills
to work with modules,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.290
now that HTML imports are
kind of on the dying end.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.704
So we've switched to using
modules for everything.

00:04:43.704 --> 00:04:45.370
And the polyfills
also work with modules

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.160
and don't try to import HTML
imports and stuff like that.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.870
JAKE: So with the
HTML imports, that

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.430
would have your styles
in there, and then

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.200
the definitions for
your custom elements.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.022
How does that look
in a module world?

00:04:59.022 --> 00:05:01.230
MONICA DINCULESCU: So, in
a module world, all of that

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.360
looks together, but
in a giant, you know,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.410
template JavaScript literal.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.662
This is what a template
literal looks like.

00:05:07.662 --> 00:05:09.120
SURMA: I mean,
yeah, with lit HTML,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.536
it makes sense
because you already

00:05:10.536 --> 00:05:14.887
have your markup in an HTML
template tag string literal

00:05:14.887 --> 00:05:16.720
anyway, so it kind of
just adds some styles.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.145
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yeah.

00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:18.160
SURMA: Put the markup in there.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.993
MONICA DINCULESCU: So
we've updated ShadyDOM

00:05:19.993 --> 00:05:22.090
to work with that so you
can have a module that

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.150
exports a style node
with all its goodness,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.711
and import it as a squiggle
inside of your render function.

00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:29.710
SURMA: I think that's
actually a proper keyword.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.590
It's a squiggle.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.800
MONICA DINCULESCU: What
do you call the squiggles?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.380
JAKE: Code braces?

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.290
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yeah.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.710
Squiggles.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.043
SURMA: Imported with a squiggle.

00:05:36.043 --> 00:05:36.799
I like that.

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:38.090
JAKE: Imported with a squiggle.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.490
That's your new
tag-line for polymer.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.236
MONICA DINCULESCU: Thank you.

00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:41.540
JAKE: I think that's good.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.190
So we've been doing some work
with web components recently,

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.130
and my feeling is the polyfill
for straight-up custom elements

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.480
is super light and small and
great, and everything's happy.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.529
But my feeling with the
Shadow DOM polyfills--

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:59.070
MONICA DINCULESCU:
Yeah, it turns out

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.800
reinventing the DOM in
JavaScript is really hard.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.975
Who saw that coming?

00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:04.770
SURMA: It's not an easy problem.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.110
MONICA DINCULESCU: It's
not an easy problem.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.970
And the problem is it's
not really the DOM.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.160
It's the CSS parts--

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.150
SURMA: It's a
scoping thing, right?

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.650
MONICA DINCULESCU: --and telling
CSS that it needs to update

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.040
and runs some styles
when things update.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.490
So that's what makes it hard.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.194
So if you're using
all of them together,

00:06:19.194 --> 00:06:21.610
it's very easy because you get
a callback when all of them

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.410
have rendered.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.600
But mostly, you have
to take a template

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.630
and be like, hey, Shady DOM
and CSS, here's a template.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.950
Do your thing so that--

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.500
you imbibe it with magic
so that it works later.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.110
JAKE: If we're
building stuff now

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.880
with the hope of it
sort of being there

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.046
in the future, where all
browser support [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.810
web components
things, should people

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.976
be sort of avoiding
Shadow DOM for now?

00:06:42.976 --> 00:06:44.350
MONICA DINCULESCU:
No, I like it.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.530
JAKE: No?

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.970
We should go all
in on Shadow DOM?

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:46.560
MONICA DINCULESCU:
Shadow DOM is--

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.900
JAKE: Stuff's not
going to break?

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.460
MONICA DINCULESCU: --very
good if you need Shadow DOM.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.918
Shadow DOM gives
you encapsulation.

00:06:50.918 --> 00:06:53.010
SURMA: Now that's the
worst tag-line I've seen.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.760
MONICA DINCULESCU:
[DISGRUNTLED NOISE] No,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.560
"Shadow DOM hides
you in a corner"

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.500
is probably the worst tag-line.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.990
JAKE: I like, "Shadow DOM,
it's there if you need it."

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.270
That's a very
wholesome tag-line.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.520
MONICA DINCULESCU: If you're
like a reusable component

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.380
library-- you're
Vaadin or Ionic--

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.990
and you're making a button-- or
you're a design system instead

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.892
of a big company--

00:07:11.892 --> 00:07:12.850
you're making a button.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.332
That button has to always be
that kind of shade of blue.

00:07:15.332 --> 00:07:16.540
You want Shadow DOM for that.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.580
You don't want anybody poking
and prodding it, being like,

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.320
your shade of blue is
slightly incorrect.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.060
I'll just add my
fourteenth shade of blue

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.230
to this application, right?

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.438
You want Shadow DOM for that.

00:07:24.438 --> 00:07:28.270
But if you're building the
top view of an application,

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.622
maybe you want something like a
jQuery plugin to work in there.

00:07:31.622 --> 00:07:33.580
Maybe that's not going
to work with Shadow DOM.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.280
Maybe that's a thing that you
don't want encapsulation for.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.270
JAKE: So I tried to
build a web component

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.680
of doing syntax highlighting.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.680
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yeah.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.730
JAKE: So just an element,
you put your code in.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:43.875
It syntax highlights it.

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:45.790
And it felt like Shadow
DOM was a good choice

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.290
there because it's going to
hide all of those extra elements

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.500
that I needed to do that
syntax highlighting.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.402
But I was worried about the
amount of extra polyfill

00:07:53.402 --> 00:07:54.610
I'm going to need to do that.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.079
But also, how do I get
user styling in there

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.120
if they wanted to change
the syntax highlighting?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.286
MONICA DINCULESCU: Oh man, do
I have exciting news for you.

00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:02.260
JAKE: Ready-- no, no.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.250
I'm not ready.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:03.610
MONICA DINCULESCU:
Are you ready?

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:04.210
JAKE: Yes.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:04.890
Yeah, I'm ready.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.390
OK.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.220
MONICA DINCULESCU:
There's a new spec.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.210
I'm very excited about it.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.410
It's called Part and Theme.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.916
And it basically works how--

00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:10.790
JAKE: Part and Theme.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.660
MONICA DINCULESCU:
Part and Theme.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.951
They come together as a couple.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.700
Well, actually, they
come as cousins.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.640
JAKE: As a couple?

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.157
Oh, gosh, this is sounding
really bad already.

00:08:20.157 --> 00:08:20.990
So they're a couple.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.990
They're cousins.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.034
MONICA DINCULESCU: No.

00:08:23.034 --> 00:08:24.700
JAKE: And this is
something we all want?

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.784
MONICA DINCULESCU: No, no.

00:08:25.784 --> 00:08:27.408
SURMA: I think we
shouldn't shame them.

00:08:27.408 --> 00:08:28.940
MONICA DINCULESCU:
You're a monster.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.320
MONICA DINCULESCU: No.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.970
So Part is basically-- when
you're building a custom

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.299
element, it lets you
specify little divs,

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.549
or little elements, that a
user might want to style.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.570
And you put a part on them,
and you give them a name.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.960
Say, if you are
an input element,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.370
you would call them
a webkit placeholder,

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.299
or a webkit spinner up,
and webkit spinner down--

00:08:45.299 --> 00:08:46.090
JAKE AND SURMA: Oh.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.410
MONICA DINCULESCU: --those
are basically the parts

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.460
that input exposes for styling.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.586
So then you could do this
too, as a custom element.

00:08:51.586 --> 00:08:54.001
And you'd be like, these are
the bases that you can style.

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.120
And then you can use them.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.920
You can use pseudo
selectors and hovers

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.290
and shit like that on
them, and they work.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.240
SURMA: So the fun fact
is that we invited you

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.700
to this CSS working group
because of these two

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.390
new things--

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:04.900
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yes.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.830
SURMA: --and then we
didn't talk about them.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.990
MONICA DINCULESCU: Correct.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.198
But then I learned how
layouting works, so it's fine.

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:11.450
SURMA: You're also a member
of the Emoji Committee,

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.950
and that's something where we
actually know what's going on.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.710
MONICA DINCULESCU:
Sub-committee, thank you.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.580
Emoji Sub-committee.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.950
SURMA: Sorry.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.736
So how is there no shark emoji,
but there is a dinosaur emoji?

00:09:21.736 --> 00:09:23.860
MONICA DINCULESCU: Do you
know how much people have

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.176
whined for the dinosaur emoji?

00:09:25.176 --> 00:09:27.550
Do you know how many people
asked for the dinosaur emoji?

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.341
SURMA: No, I don't.

00:09:28.341 --> 00:09:30.121
But it's not a real animal.

00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:30.870
I mean, it's real.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.260
It doesn't exist anymore.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.160
While a shark--

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.310
MONICA DINCULESCU:
There's floppy disks,

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.630
and they don't exist anymore.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.380
SURMA: That's art.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:36.940
JAKE: Oh.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.460
MONICA DINCULESCU:
So emoji get accepted

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.387
based on how many people--

00:09:42.387 --> 00:09:44.470
it's not necessarily how
many people request them,

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.750
but how popular that concept is.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.760
And if you search for
dinosaur on Google,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.256
you'll find a bunch of results
because a lot of people

00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:52.130
talk about dinosaurs.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.380
And when you're trying
to text somebody,

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.540
you would like a
representation of a dinosaur.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.670
I agree that sharks
should also be there.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.900
Maybe nobody proposed it.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.983
JAKE: Is that what we're
saying, is that dinosaurs

00:10:00.983 --> 00:10:02.449
are more popular than sharks?

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:04.490
SURMA: I can get behind
that statement, honestly.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.650
MONICA DINCULESCU: This feels
a lot like "Shark Week,"

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.830
and I am uncomfortable
with that statement,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.340
on behalf of all
sharks out there.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.630
Maybe nobody proposed a shark.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.245
We don't propose emoji.

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:13.120
People propose emoji.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.620
We just review them.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.999
JAKE: So can we get
a HTTP203 emoji?

00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:18.790
What's the process?

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.665
How do we start that?

00:10:19.665 --> 00:10:23.430
And what characters would
you have to combine?

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.900
SURMA: So first, we need to
get a Surma and Jake emoji--

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.150
MONICA DINCULESCU: Oh, my god.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.620
You guys, there is this emoji.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.475
This emoji exists.

00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:30.746
It's like the two bunny boys.

00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:32.704
There were the two bunny
girls, and now there's

00:10:32.704 --> 00:10:33.496
the two bunny boys.

00:10:33.496 --> 00:10:34.870
JAKE: Well, I
thought, for me, it

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.020
would have to be the
boy emoji and then

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.549
the white color, and then
the white color, and then

00:10:39.549 --> 00:10:41.340
the white color, and
the white color again.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.375
And then it would be
like, that's Jake.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:43.920
MONICA DINCULESCU: Shockingly,
your shade of white

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.086
is not on the Fitzpatrick
scale quite yet.

00:10:46.086 --> 00:10:48.460
JAKE: We need to invent a new
color space, I think, for--

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.675
it's whatever's after HDR.

00:10:49.675 --> 00:10:51.706
MONICA DINCULESCU: The
reflective color space.

00:10:51.706 --> 00:10:53.580
JAKE: We've had to do
all sorts of gymnastics

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.880
with covers to stop me just
kind of exploding the cameras.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.930
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yeah,
they paid no attention

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.930
to Surma and I, and they
set up lighting for you

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:00.660
for 45 minutes.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.110
JAKE: Yeah, I know.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.776
SURMA: Otherwise,
he's just a reflector.

00:11:02.776 --> 00:11:05.660
I become lighter because the
sun reflects off his face.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.118
MONICA DINCULESCU: I burned
some light bulbs in my kitchen,

00:11:08.118 --> 00:11:09.810
if you want to just
come hang out there.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.915
JAKE: We're going to link to
your talk in the show notes.

00:11:11.915 --> 00:11:12.290
MONICA DINCULESCU: Yes.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.710
JAKE: Which you haven't
given yet, but--

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.841
MONICA DINCULESCU:
It's going to be great.

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:16.270
SURMA: How will
your audience have

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.560
reacted by the point
you've given your talk?

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.060
MONICA DINCULESCU: It's going
to be amazing, best talk ever.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.721
No talking comes second to it.
