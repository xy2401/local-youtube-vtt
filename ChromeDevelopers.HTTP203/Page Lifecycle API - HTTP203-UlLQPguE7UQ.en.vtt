It doesn't matter.

to a browser near you, the Page

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.190
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.570
I've been reading an article--

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.300
well, OK.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.150
So I was involved very roughly
at the start of this API.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.190
But I didn't have time to do
anything meaningful to it.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.730
SURMA: That's just
the career, man.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.860
JAKE: Yeah.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.610
I was saying that at the start,
it seems like it lends me some

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.600
credibility, but
it really doesn't.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.749

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.780
JAKE: Yeah.

JAKE: --pages go away,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.940

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.100
JAKE: --the whole
browser goes away.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.600
SURMA: --when you go away
from the browser, or just

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.260
different tab?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.440
Or--

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.400
JAKE: Different tabs, as well.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.580
SURMA: Yeah.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.130
JAKE: Yeah.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.380
If you go to a different tab--

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.850
SURMA: Doesn't it have, like,
I'm going to type something in.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.670
Oh, I need to look up what
the code was on the other tab.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.360
Go back, go back,
everything is gone.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.057
Noooo!

00:01:43.057 --> 00:01:43.640
JAKE: Exactly.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.110
And so it's worse on
devices with less memory.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.860
If you got a bit more
memory, it's better.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.140
But I think, by default,
if a tab has not

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.390
been used for five minutes
on Android, we get rid.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.370
SURMA: OK.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.620
JAKE: Other mobile platforms do
exactly the same thing, right?

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.650
Like, phones have less memory.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.080
So it's kind of like, can we
get that into the specs somehow?

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.370
Can we do the sensible thing?

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.744
So the current
state of things is

00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:11.990
that, we can think of a
page having an active state

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.340
and a passive state.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.600
This exists already.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.492
Active is, you're
using that page.

00:02:16.492 --> 00:02:17.450
You're clicking around.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.350
You're doing stuff.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.880
Brilliant.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.599
And then passive
is, it's blurred.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.640
SURMA: You've lost focus.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.051
JAKE: You've lost focus.

00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:27.800
And that's what we
call the passive state.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.410
And you get events for that.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.700
You've had events for that
for ages-- unfocused, blur.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.400
Yeah.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.379
unfocus, unblur.

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.170
SURMA: But these are
the only [INAUDIBLE],,

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.930
because these are also on
the input elements, right?

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.940
When an individual input
element gets focus,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.990
literally, the code is in there.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.850
But there's also
document-level focus and blur.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.510
JAKE: Exactly.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.680
Yes.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.031
And so when it's in the
passive state, it could still--

00:02:47.031 --> 00:02:49.030
because it will run
JavaScript and stuff, right?

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.050
Because that's your--

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.261
SURMA: setTimeout [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:51.760
JAKE: Yeah.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.470
Some things might be reduced.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.100
They tend not to be too much
because it's still visible.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.144
It could be on your
second monitor, your--

00:03:00.144 --> 00:03:01.810
SURMA: Yes, but we're
not talking mobile

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.647
here exclusively.

00:03:02.647 --> 00:03:04.480
We're talking about
both mobile and desktop.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.979
JAKE: Yes.

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.750
But I mean, with phones
that have split screen view,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.220
you could still have
this style thing.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.900
And then the next
state is Hidden.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.765
SURMA: Ah, that's
Visibility API, isn't it?

00:03:16.765 --> 00:03:17.640
JAKE: Visibility API.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.389
So you've got the
Visibility Change event.

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.970
And this is when you
switch to another tab.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.710
SURMA: Does the desktop actually
detect occlusion, as well?

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.090
JAKE: Do you know what?

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.300
I knew you were
going to ask this.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.700
So I tested it, and it does not.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.199
SURMA: Cool.

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.530
JAKE: But do you know what?

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.844
Browsers could do that.

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:32.260
That would be a
valid thing to do.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.420
So what they do-- or the
ones I tested anyway,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.920
which is browsers on Mac,
Firefox, Safari, and Chrome--

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.330
I should remember that last one.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.880
If you switch desktops,
it will Visibility

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.630
Hidden, because
technically, it is hidden.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.180
SURMA: Full screen?

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.170
Or also on workspace
to workspace?

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.800
JAKE: So--

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.260
SURMA: I gotcha!

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.020
Didn't test that.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.960
JAKE: Yeah, I didn't
test full screen.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.876
But I presume it would
work because it's still

00:03:54.876 --> 00:03:56.740
going onto a desktop
that's dominant view.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.120
So you get events
for that as well.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.920
And then you can go from
Hidden to Terminated, right?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.500
You close a tab.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.230
It's going to go
through those phases.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.800
And it is mostly a line, right?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.580
You can go--

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.240
SURMA: Yeah, it's like a--

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.440
JAKE: Active and
Passive in Mac, you

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.180
can go from Passive
to Hidden, then back.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.680
You can go from
Hidden to Terminate.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.850
You can't go back
from that one, but--

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:16.349
SURMA: True.

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.720
But you can't go
from Hidden to--

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.347
JAKE: Active.

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:21.430
SURMA: Active in one step.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.846
There has to be the "you are
now visible" step in between.

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:26.547
So it's like a nice hierarchy
of states that you can be in.

00:04:26.547 --> 00:04:27.130
JAKE: Exactly.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.421
And saying that you can't go
from Active to Terminated,

00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:31.034
ah, except if--

00:04:31.034 --> 00:04:31.950
SURMA: Except you can.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.070
JAKE: I think on mobile you can.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.810
And that's like if the
browser goes out of memory.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.268
If a tab crashes,
of course, you've

00:04:36.268 --> 00:04:38.230
gone from Active to Terminated.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.120
But mostly, it's a
nice linear system.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.272
New bits.

00:04:43.272 --> 00:04:44.230
From the Hidden state--

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.271
SURMA: So what's missing?

00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:46.650
Why are we doing new bits?

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.649
JAKE: Well, so--

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:50.440
SURMA: Because you want
to hook into these.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.940
And we have a couple of events.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.050
JAKE: So we want this new
state called "Frozen."

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.630
SURMA: OK.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.850
JAKE: And this is
where you've got--

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.460
we want to start
turning off timers.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.259
We want to start, essentially--

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:03.550
SURMA: Like set timeout timers.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.174
JAKE: We want to stop
the page running.

00:05:05.174 --> 00:05:06.160
SURMA: OK.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.720
JAKE: But--

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.720
SURMA: Not terminate it.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.470
JAKE: We want to be able to--

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.130
yeah, we want to be
able to bring back.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.396
You're still going
to use memory.

00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:14.770
Or I mean, I suppose you could
write that memory to disk.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.197
SURMA: I guess you
want to freeze it.

00:05:17.197 --> 00:05:19.030
JAKE: That would be a
good name for it, yes.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.990
Exactly.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.280
So this is the new state.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.950
And it's also browsers that
have a back-forward page

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.280
cache are going to use to
define that, the BF cache.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.651
So yeah, it's called Frozen.

00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:30.400
And then so you'll get
a Frozen event when

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.340
it goes from Hidden to Frozen,
and a Resume event when

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.100
it goes from Frozen to Hidden.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.790
And another new state, from
Frozen, it can go to Discarded.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.300
SURMA: OK.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.750
JAKE: And this is
specifically for that.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.860
It's gone, but there might
still be UI representing it.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.360
And this is what
you have on mobile,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.320
because although we get--

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.830
SURMA: Ah, is this
the Android thing

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.560
where they just save the
screenshot, more or less,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.100
off the app so we
can swipe through.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.210
But if you actually activate
it, it actually has to boot up.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.880
JAKE: Exactly.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.780
And so, yeah, even Androids,
the browser goes out of memory,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.520
you open it up, all
those tabs are there.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.936
Some of them,
through screenshots,

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:10.720
try and pretend that
they're still active.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.630
But they're not.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.330
They're going to
do a full reload.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.850
So this is a new thing.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.590
You've got events
for all of these,

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.790
including these new ones.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.373
SURMA: All of these,
and the old ones,

00:06:20.373 --> 00:06:21.612
as well, you said are events.

00:06:21.612 --> 00:06:22.570
JAKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.361
They're all events.

00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:26.050
SURMA: So can I prevent
defaulting, and be like, no!

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.880
I don't want you to suspend me!

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.050
JAKE: You may not.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.839
No.

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:32.380
You can react to them, but no,
you can't control any of them.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.820
SURMA: That's interesting.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.400
So you say I can react to them.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.540
So there's a grace
period where I'm still

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.797
allowed to run code
before the actual freezing

00:06:39.797 --> 00:06:40.630
or whatever happens?

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.332
JAKE: So the recommendation
is, on Hidden,

00:06:43.332 --> 00:06:45.040
when you get into the
Hidden stage, which

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.310
is that you use the Visibility
Change to pick that up--

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.869
save any data that you--

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:51.160
SURMA: Like to IDB or whatever.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.780
JAKE: To IDB or whatever.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.590
And when you get
the Freeze event,

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.320
you have the length of that
event, really, synchronously.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.950
SURMA: So no async.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.450
JAKE: There might
be a grace period,

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.850
but you really,
for safety, would

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.690
treat that as synchronous.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.100
SURMA: Wouldn't this be a great
use case for like prevent F4--

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.829
JAKE: For wait until-- yeah.

00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:09.370
That was discussed,
but I don't think

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.210
anyone could agree on
what the time should be.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.170
And there's worries
about, people would just

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.480
use it to keep the page
alive or something like that.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.660
SURMA: Yeah, OK, fair.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.743
JAKE: I mean, that might
still happen in some ways

00:07:19.743 --> 00:07:22.150
because heuristics--
if sound is playing,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.040
it's not going to freeze a tab.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.160
So you'd get that hackware,
play an empty sound.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.490
And you use everyone's battery,
but you get to stay alive.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.230
So yeah, but on Freeze, you
get that length of time.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.850
And this is like an API
which I have not used in ages

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.550
comes into play.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.220
And that's session storage.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.970
So there's a bit of
special behavior here.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.120
And I was looking at
the spec versus the--

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.190
this doesn't seem well
written in the space.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.600
It's kind of as an example.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.920
But the suggestion is that,
if a tab is discarded--

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.470
so the page is
essentially unloaded.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.696
It's gone.

00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:01.820
You saw that the tab there.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.900
And when you click back to
it, it's going to reload.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.709
Session storage will persist.

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:07.500
SURMA: Interesting.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.800
JAKE: Because the
tab is still there.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.008
SURMA: But if I close the
tab, and then Command-Shift

00:08:11.008 --> 00:08:12.380
to reopen, that will be--

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.570
JAKE: Then it's gone.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.290
So it's a nice safe place
to put data that's--

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.500
for maybe legal reasons or for
usability reasons-- that you

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.040
don't think should persist
beyond the life of a tab,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.420
but it will persist
beyond discarding.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.720
And once the page reloads, there
is document dot was discarded.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.700
SURMA: Oh, for if you're
being restored or actually

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.650
being loaded completely fresh.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.870
JAKE: So if the user
closes the tab to the app,

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.500
and they go back to it, we
could, using web storage,

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.400
show them--

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.800
put the app into the
same state it was before.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.159
And I've always been really
unsure about that because--

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:49.700
SURMA: I mean, it
depends on the app.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.770
But in this app it seems
unexpected, I guess.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.047
JAKE: Right, because I think
one of the benefits of doing

00:08:56.047 --> 00:08:58.630
something like image compression
on the client is you can say,

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.780
we're not sending it to
the server or anything.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.010
This is fine to use
for private data.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.310
But the problem is, someone
puts a sensitive image

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.190
into the app, close
the app, and then

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.270
they give their laptop
someone else or something,

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.030
or they open it on stage.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.915
And suddenly there's,
let's say, a receipt

00:09:16.915 --> 00:09:18.040
with important information.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.539
SURMA: Yeah.

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:19.280
Not nudes.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.030
JAKE: Not nudes, no.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.150
But with this, this sounds like
a good way of doing it, right,

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.360
this being able to--

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:26.414
SURMA: Yeah.

00:09:26.414 --> 00:09:28.180
Now, you have a proper
semantic for when to check

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.350
what you've stored, and--

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.933
JAKE: Because it
seems understandable,

00:09:30.933 --> 00:09:32.860
if there's a tab
still there, it's

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.660
understanding from
a user's perspective

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.792
that if they go
back into that tab,

00:09:36.792 --> 00:09:38.750
it should be in the same
state as they left it.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.160
SURMA: Yes.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:39.440
Exactly.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.750
JAKE: In fact, it's almost
unexpected to be the opposite.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.130
SURMA: I haven't looked at
session storage ever, I think.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.900
Is it synchronous
like local storage?

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.840
JAKE: Yep.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.460
It's the same kind of API.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:54.310
The benefit of it in
legal terms, I think,

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.500
is that the storage
is held in memory.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.810
I think in certain
circumstances,

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.240
rules change once
that goes onto disk.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.230
SURMA: Yeah.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.937
And you've got--

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.520
I think, historically you would
be using cookies or something,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.240
but that would actually
go onto the network.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.190
And you don't want that.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.610
JAKE: Right, and that's on disk,
as well, and on the network.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.943
I think it's just local storage.

00:10:12.943 --> 00:10:16.210
SURMA: So Lifecycle API,
you said it's in Chrome 68?

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.170
JAKE: Chrome 68.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.620
There's some nice
debugging tools.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.240
If you go to Chrome
colon Discards,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.930
there's a nice little API
there where you can put pages

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.230
into certain states.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.892
Because we have ambitions to
do this on desktop, as well.

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:30.850
SURMA: I would hope so.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.360
JAKE: Because, I mean, I
don't know about the amount

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.296
of tabs you have.

00:10:33.296 --> 00:10:34.420
SURMA: I have many of them.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.940
And I am the Great Suspender,
because I have so many tabs,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.990
and they all stay active.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.490
Right?

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.849
So I have a Chrome extension
that puts them to sleep.

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:41.890
JAKE: Puts them to sleep.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:42.390
Right.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.070
SURMA: So if I cannot
have to have an extension,

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.210
but rather Chrome do it
itself, I'm all for that.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.900
JAKE: And it's good
for memory, as well,

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.191
because you know that stuff's--

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:53.174
SURMA: But to be clear,
this is a standard, right?

00:10:53.174 --> 00:10:54.590
JAKE: Yes, this
is a web standard.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.950
It's on the YCG Page Lifecycle.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.049
Yeah.

00:10:58.049 --> 00:11:00.340
Things like back-forward
cache have been built into it.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.060
So it's not just with Chrome in
mind, it's with other browsers,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.810
as well.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:05.310
SURMA: Cool.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.790
JAKE: So Safari and Firefox
have the back-forward cache.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:08.490
Yeah.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.760
I think it's really good.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.344
I think it's not
just good for mobile,

00:11:11.344 --> 00:11:13.051
I think it's going to
be good for desktop

00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:14.042
down the line as well.

00:11:14.042 --> 00:11:15.290
SURMA: Cool.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.900
JAKE: I'm not
entirely comfortable

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.970
with the idea of human contact.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.420
I don't think it's right.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.420
SURMA: I mean, that's not
surprising considering

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.230
you are very vocal about
not being a hugger.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.740
JAKE: Yeah.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.720
I'm not a great hugger.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.100
I do it if necessary.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.950
[LAUGHTER]
