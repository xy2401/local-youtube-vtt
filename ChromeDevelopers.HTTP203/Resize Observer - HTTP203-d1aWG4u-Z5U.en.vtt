00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.210
JAKE ARCHIBALD: There's
a lot of observers

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.020
that I don't know
why we have them.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:05.520
SURMA: OK.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.061
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Because a lot
of them it's just sort of like,

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:10.420
uh, this doesn't
feel like an event

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.230
or this is batched work
or something like that.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.487
And the go-to has been to
create an observer for it.

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:17.820
And really, you don't need that.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.070
We could just use [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.810
SURMA: I can come up with
three observers right now.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.190
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Mutation,
resize, intersection.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.550
I can also come up with three.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.730
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.990
Anyone who's done some
work with CSS at some point

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.280
using responsive stuff
with media queries and such

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.040
has kind of had the idea, ha,
this media query stuff is OK,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.200
but what I really
would like is a way

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.970
to style this
element differently

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.320
to how big this element is.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.020
And then, go on Twitter and
say, hey, I've had a bright idea

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.117
or file a bug about it.

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:01.950
I'm basically saying
what I did, by the way.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.540
This is what I did years ago.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.140
And people were like yes, yes.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.932
SURMA: We know.

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.890
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Many
people have had this idea.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.970
The reason we can't just
have element queries

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.800
is because you can end
up with a query which

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.090
changes based on width.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.800
And as a result, it changes
width and you end up in--

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.300
SURMA: Whee.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.758
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
--an infinite loop.

00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:22.445
Bad idea, right?

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:23.750
SURMA: That seems pretty bad.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.374
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So there's a web
standard called ResizeObserver

00:01:26.374 --> 00:01:28.010
and it's stable in Chrome.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.440
And [INAUDIBLE] for an element
you just say that element

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.300
there--

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.180
SURMA: Observe.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.471
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, let me
know when it changes size.

00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:36.590
SURMA: All right, that's cool.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.580
So that means it can react.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.450
It's a JavaScript API, so it
can react with JavaScript.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.450
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.270
SURMA: So we are back at
the infinite loop problem.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.120
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So I
was reading your article

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.290
and you've got a
section on that.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.060
SURMA: Do I?

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.268
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You've got,
yeah, just a little bit--

00:01:50.268 --> 00:01:52.430
a little bit of text on it.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.740
Changes will only be
processed in the same frame

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.750
if the resize element is
deeper in the DOM tree

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.208
than the shallowest
element process

00:01:58.208 --> 00:01:59.286
in the previous callback.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:00.410
SURMA: That's a weird menu.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Perfect.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.450
So that's just words.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.250
That's just some words
you like in an order.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.217
SURMA: I think I explained
it pretty concisely.

00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:12.550
This that actually what I wrote?

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.010
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.690
Talk us through it.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.290
SURMA: OK.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.860
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm just
saying that because I

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.901
don't understand some, so
taking advantage of it.

00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:21.850
SURMA: So imagine you have
an element that has children,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.600
as is common.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.320
And you call
ResizeObserver.observe

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.180
on this element.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.461
JAKE ARCHIBALD: On the parent?

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:30.460
SURMA: Yeah, on the big.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.630
JAKE ARCHIBALD: All right,
all right, all right.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.838
SURMA: That means whenever
this element changes size,

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:35.870
you will get a callback
and you can react to it.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.685
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Cool.

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:37.030
Excellent.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.529
Yeah.

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:39.190
SURMA: So now, let's
assume you also

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.100
call another
ResizeObserver.observe on one

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.397
of the children.

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:45.980
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK, because as
a result of the parent changing

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.930
size, the children could change.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.346
SURMA: Could change
size, and want

00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:51.100
to be notified about both,
so both ResizeObservers would

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.144
fire their callbacks and
you would get notified.

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:55.060
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.830
SURMA: Let's assume
a third thing

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.040
that in one of the
children's callbacks,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.424
I change the parent's size.

00:03:01.424 --> 00:03:03.090
It's JavaScript,
that's possible, right?

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.830
I can just change
anything in the DOM.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.040
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Gotcha.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.220
And it could even
be done implicitly

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.110
by changing the size of
the child, which would--

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.935
SURMA: Potentially,
if it's just text flow

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:11.410
or just append some text.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.493
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right, OK.

00:03:12.493 --> 00:03:15.430
SURMA: The parent could suddenly
grow, and then technically,

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.529
the outer-- the bigger--

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.070
ResizeObserver from
the other element

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.110
will have to fire again, and the
smaller one probably as well,

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.680
and then it could same happen
again, and again, and again.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.500
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
There's your loop.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.880
SURMA: And how we
break this loop

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.310
is with a rule that
ResizeObservers--

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.880
all the ResizeObserver
will fire in the same frame

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.937
before layout.

00:03:31.937 --> 00:03:33.520
And if you change
within the same one,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.070
they will also fire
within the same frame,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.520
unless the change has been
made to an element that

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.682
is at the same level or
higher up the DOM tree.

00:03:41.682 --> 00:03:44.140
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So it's like,
in terms of how we talk about

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.902
events capturing, it's--

00:03:45.902 --> 00:03:47.110
SURMA: It's reverse bubbling.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.980
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Yeah, but capturing.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.530
So that's the-- ah, so
that's the direction it goes.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.980
SURMA: So you can only
have multiple invocations

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.440
of your callbacks
downwards of the tree.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.302
But if some of them that
are high up in the tree

00:03:59.302 --> 00:04:00.760
would have to
refire, that would be

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.969
delayed until the next frame.

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:03.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
what you're saying

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.890
is that the change is only
processed in the same frame

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.342
if the resized element
is deeper in the DOM tree

00:04:09.342 --> 00:04:10.999
than the shallowest
element processed

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:12.040
in the previous callback.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.623
SURMA: That's exactly
what I'm saying.

00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:16.399
And that's actually
what I wrote.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.899
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It
makes sense now.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.881
It's perfect.

00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:22.089
You should have put that in
the article like you did.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.506
SURMA: I think at
the end, I think

00:04:23.506 --> 00:04:25.214
I remember writing
this article and there

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:26.770
were lots of things changing.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.630
And so, I got a bit
annoyed because I

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.560
think I was working on an
animation, and at the end,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.139
I was like, nah.

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.430
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Just copy
and paste that from the spec.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.100
Job done.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.470
All right, well, yes.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.140
I like it.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.680
I think we should keep
it in the browser.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.530
I think other people
should implement it.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.580
SURMA: That's us doing
advocacy, isn't it?

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.622
Other people should
implement it, please.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.830
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We didn't
give that trendy weightless

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.290
CSS name, did we?

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.790
Did I?

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.040
SURMA: Is it layout enhancer.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.040
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Layout enhancer--

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.020
I think I get a lot of emails
about that to my Spam folder.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.450
So this is a real cafe?

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.000
It's a real cafe, yes?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.510
Of course.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.135
[INAUDIBLE] podcast,
could be anywhere.

00:05:09.135 --> 00:05:09.903
It could be--

00:05:09.903 --> 00:05:10.444
SURMA: Space.

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:12.007
In space.

00:05:12.007 --> 00:05:14.340
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Now, when we
do the two minute segments,

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.770
I want that as the noise.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.350
You just go space.
