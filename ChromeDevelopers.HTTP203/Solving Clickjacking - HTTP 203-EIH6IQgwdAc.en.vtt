00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:02.300
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So what
are you doing this evening?

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.000
I don't know.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.490
I don't have any small talk.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.901
I didn't become a
developer to do small talk.

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:10.310
It's literally why I became
a developer, because I can't.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.893
SURMA: Maybe we can
sneak out and just

00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:13.640
replace ourselves with--

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.730
SPEAKER: And action.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.110
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:24.350
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.048
SURMA: So.

00:00:25.048 --> 00:00:25.840
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.350
SURMA: We haven't used it
in the last two episodes.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.060
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
We're using it now,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.350
and we're going to use it a lot.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.890
So--

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.740
SURMA: So.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --I want
to talk about clickjacking.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.963
SURMA: Oh, yes.

00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:35.630
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Now,
this is a hack that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.940
was discovered in the 2000s.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.480
SURMA: Yeah.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.860
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
And this is where

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.150
you'd have a setup like this.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.870
You have a button that's
part of a website,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.630
and then you have this, which
is an iframe to another website.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.085
SURMA: Mm-hm.

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:50.930
Another website.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.388
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Some other website,

00:00:52.388 --> 00:00:54.750
some other social media site.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.490
And the idea is, you click that,
and it will like this page.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.400
It's bringing an interactive
element from another site

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.670
onto your site.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.670
Yes, and because it's an
iframe, any clicks that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.000
are happening there will
be owned by the iframe--

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.500
SURMA: Yeah.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.790
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.070
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --rather
than the parent page--

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.240
SURMA: Yes.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.290
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --to the
point where, in order

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.610
to drag this around, I've had
to add this little bit here,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.620
which is part of
the parent page,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.037
because if I do that, the click
goes into the iframe and I

00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:18.840
can't control it.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.010
So clickjacking was
this thing where

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.260
people would abuse this
feature by tricking people

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.730
to like a page, buy something,
or generally interact

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.360
with a site that they don't
think they're interacting with.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.330
And what would happen is,
they would put a button,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.788
like, over the top, like
this, but then make it--

00:01:41.788 --> 00:01:43.330
SURMA: This is the
worst clickjacking

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.680
attempt I've ever seen!

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.930
JAKE ARCHIBALD: This is great!

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.340
And then you'll get--

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.590
SURMA: You want to click this.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.400
Click me, please.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.100
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I
would fall for it.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.610
SURMA: Please, sir!

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.110
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I
would fall for it.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.860
I'm quite stupid.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.510
But it'll give it [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.420
So when you click that, that
would go down into the iframe

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.290
and you've liked the page.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.250
Another way of doing it would be
to put the Like button on top,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.590
but bring the
opacity of it down.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.840
So you're clicking there,
but you're actually clicking

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.923
on the iframe, which is on top.

00:02:08.923 --> 00:02:10.340
Oh, various other
tricks you could

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.613
do by visually
obscuring it like that

00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:15.030
and tricking the
user to click it.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.470
They don't realize it's--

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.933
although that content is
controlled by the other site,

00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:20.600
you've done something
to it to the point

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.220
where it's no longer legible.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.800
Another one would be to put
a message there and just

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.270
encourage the user tech click
on this little bit here.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.680
And the context of
the actual button

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.690
is gone, because you've covered
it up [INAUDIBLE] with this.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.030
So this was a problem.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.530
SURMA: Yes.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.140
JAKE ARCHIBALD: This is a
problem that they had to fix.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.530
And they fixed it in
sort of 2009-2010,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.970
depending on the browser.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.123
And this was the solution.

00:02:46.123 --> 00:02:47.540
SURMA: The X-Frame
Options header.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.735
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
this is another one

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.110
of the things in
the web platform

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.990
that should have
been the default.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.740
But because it wasn't
there at the start--

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.710
SURMA: Just like cause.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.680
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --just like
cause and like no cause

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.380
blah, blah, blah.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.750
So you put this
header, and that says,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.850
I cannot be in an iframe--

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.660
SURMA: OK.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.952
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --because,
as well as things like Like

00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:09.410
buttons, what people
were doing was

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.430
creating like a
whack-a-mole game, where

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.890
you're playing whack-a-mole,
like, oh, blip, blip, blip,

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.390
blip.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.030
SURMA: Oh!

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.257
Then suddenly, Like button.

00:03:18.257 --> 00:03:20.090
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, but
what you didn't know

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.590
was there was an iframe over
the top of, like, Amazon,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.240
and those moles were
appearing in the places

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.240
where you would navigate
your way through Amazon

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.200
and buy a thing.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.860
SURMA: Wow.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.150
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And that
was one of the hacks

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.650
that you could
actually get the user

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.030
to navigate around the site.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.602
And if you knew roughly where
the buttons were going to be--

00:03:38.602 --> 00:03:39.810
SURMA: That's pretty amazing.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.643
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:03:40.643 --> 00:03:42.820
So this was the
solution for that.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.200
SURMA: But the
social button thing

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.783
works with iframes
to this day, right?

00:03:47.783 --> 00:03:49.450
JAKE ARCHIBALD: They
want to be iframes.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.960
So what you'll see that happens
now is you click on the Like

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.920
button, and it will open a
new tab or a pop-up window--

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.170
SURMA: [INAUDIBLE] Like again.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.690
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --that is
just to the social media site

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.690
or to whatever site,
and that is where

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.550
you have to complete
the final interaction,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.662
because that's the
only time it's safe.

00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:06.870
SURMA: So basically, the
embedder took responsibility

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.920
for this at that point.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.337
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Yes, exactly that.

00:04:09.337 --> 00:04:10.020
SURMA: Embedee.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.680
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.055
And then, because
it's safe then,

00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:15.930
because the other site can't
render anything over the top.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.838
But people are asking
now, can we fix this?

00:04:18.838 --> 00:04:20.880
Can we make this actually
work, so you don't have

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.050
to go off to the other site?

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.630
Can we make this safe?

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.190
And in order to do this, as
the owner of this button,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.650
I would need to
confirm that nothing

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.841
has messed with the rendering of
the button in any sort of way.

00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:39.493
Like nothing's on top of it, but
also, I haven't been blurred,

00:04:39.493 --> 00:04:41.160
I haven't had filters
applied, I haven't

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.350
had anything that
is going to trick

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.663
the user into doing something--

00:04:44.663 --> 00:04:46.080
SURMA: It's
interesting, because--

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.620
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --that
I'm not aware of.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.050
SURMA: --this button probably is
still an iframe, so it hasn't--

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.360
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.030
SURMA: --really have any context
of what the other site is

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.130
doing to that iframe.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.130
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.070
SURMA: And the
IntersectionObserver

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.590
already does this a
little bit, because it

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.865
has this feature where--

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:01.980
oh, it's the first API,
that's what I want to say.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.522
IntersectionObserver
is the first API

00:05:03.522 --> 00:05:06.180
I've heard of that can
penetrate iframes in a way,

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.330
because it can track
invisibility even if you're

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.650
inside an iframe.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.037
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, there's
a couple of APIs that give you

00:05:14.037 --> 00:05:15.120
information about iframes.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.525
There's the
ancestorOrigins property

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:18.900
that will, as an
iframe, tell you

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.520
what the origins of
the parent iframes are.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.540
SURMA: Oh, I didn't
know that one!

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.990
Interesting.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.830
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's
a security feature.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.870
But as you say,
IntersectionObserver, why

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.190
do you know so much about this?

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.510
Look who wrote the article!

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.920
SURMA: That was me.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.220
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's Mr. Surma.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.960
Yes, as you say, the
IntersectionObserver

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.392
will tell you when an element--

00:05:33.392 --> 00:05:35.565
oh, you've got a
lovely demo here--

00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:36.487
is visible or not.

00:05:36.487 --> 00:05:37.570
And it works in an iframe.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.820
SURMA: So either you can
scroll the iframe out of view

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.930
or you can scroll the content
inside the iframe out of view,

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.580
and both times,
the sections will

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.660
be able to tell you
if you are visible,

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.210
which was made for stuff like
ads who want to know if they're

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.710
actually visible, so you get
paid for it, or similar things.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.340
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes,
or lazy loading--

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.820
SURMA: Lazy loading as well.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.300
True.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.050
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
--stop/starting animations

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.180
until they come into view.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.640
It's one of my favorite
additions to the web, actually.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.010
It makes a bunch of
stuff a lot simpler.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.980
SURMA: Apparently
ResizeObserver is better.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.730
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
ResizeObserver is amazing.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.180
I think this came out a
year previously, didn't it?

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.560
SURMA: Oh, that's right.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.150
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So it didn't
make it into our competition.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.233
SURMA: If you don't know
what we're talking about,

00:06:11.233 --> 00:06:16.230
watch our "HTTP 203" Christmas
2018 feature rundown.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.990
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
You're great at these.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.930
Oh, we got to get those
Likes and Subscribes.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.910
IntersectionObserver is looking
at solving the clickjacking

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.410
problem.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.590
SURMA: Cool!

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.090
All right.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.850
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So this is in
IntersectionObserver v2, which

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.210
is in Canary right now, behind
the Experimental Web Platform

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.515
Features flag.

00:06:34.515 --> 00:06:35.850
SURMA: OK.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.017
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So this is
what IntersectionObserver

00:06:38.017 --> 00:06:39.240
looks like right now.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.280
And do you know what?

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.750
I don't like this API pattern.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.720
SURMA: No, I'm not a big fan.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.095
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
It's super weird.

00:06:45.095 --> 00:06:46.170
It feels inside out.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.510
SURMA: Yeah, and you
always have the entries,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.900
but most of the time,
you only get one entry.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.983
JAKE ARCHIBALD: One entry.

00:06:50.983 --> 00:06:52.920
Yeah, I find it a really
weirdly designed API.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.020
But we'll gloss over that.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.228
This is the new bit.

00:06:56.228 --> 00:06:57.020
SURMA: Oh, options.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.860
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
So in the options,

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.660
you say you want to
track visibility.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.660
Now, IntersectionObserver
calls this thing visibility.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.910
SURMA: Which is what the
original IntersectionObserver

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.487
already--

00:07:08.487 --> 00:07:09.320
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.147
I think this is badly named.

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:12.730
SURMA: The
IntersectionObserver's kind

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.340
of correctly and both bad
named, because, yes, it

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.355
tracks intersections
with your viewport,

00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:21.130
but it's also kind
of called visibility.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.620
But to be fair, you can
use IntersectionObserver

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.690
to track actual intersections,
even off-screen,

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.850
by changing what
it is relative to.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.158
So fair game.

00:07:29.158 --> 00:07:31.700
But still, it's very confusing
this is now called visibility.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.630
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, and I
think they might rename it,

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.860
but they're kind of like--

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.360
I said, I think
this is badly named.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.193
And they said, well,
what name should it be?

00:07:39.193 --> 00:07:39.970
And I went--

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.100
SURMA: Obscuredness.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.850
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah,
and I said something

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.935
like that, definitely
not being clickjacked.

00:07:45.935 --> 00:07:47.260
I don't know.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:47.890
I don't know.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.390
So I don't know.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.670
You have to supply
the delay property.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.390
Because this is a more
expensive bit of computation,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.830
you have to give it a delay,
which just sort of de-bounces

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.020
the amount of times
you hear about it.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.145
SURMA: Why do I have to go?

00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:01.220
Why is this-- sets?

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.230
How low can I go?

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.105
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That is
as low as you can go.

00:08:04.105 --> 00:08:04.390
SURMA: OK.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: 100 is
as low as you can go.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.480
You can go higher.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.150
But 100 is as low as can go.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.570
SURMA: But you can be
nice and tell the browser,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.880
I don't need to know this often.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.070
Like--

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Yeah, this is low--

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:10.750
SURMA: --just take your time.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.530
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
--priority, just--

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:11.860
SURMA: OK.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.220
That's actually nice.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.512
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --I don't mind.

00:08:13.512 --> 00:08:20.080
And then in your doodad
thingy-bob, callback here,

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.600
in the entries, it tells you
it's visible, and it'll--

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.370
SURMA: [INAUDIBLE] obscures.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.390
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes,
well, the opposite.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.670
SURMA: It's not obscured.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.460
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
It's not obscured.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.127
Yes, see, it's gray
if you [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.945
I think it's really good.

00:08:34.945 --> 00:08:37.070
The naming aside, the
functionality is really good.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.240
And what I'm going
to do is enable it.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:40.830
There we go.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:41.330
SURMA: Cool.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.635
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK, so now
it's the same as before.

00:08:43.635 --> 00:08:46.302
There's just a bit of extra code
running in here that knows when

00:08:46.302 --> 00:08:46.445
it's--

00:08:46.445 --> 00:08:47.205
SURMA: It loads.

00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:49.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --being
hijacked or whatever.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.830
So you can see, I can
sort of move this around

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.710
and everything's fine.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.130
SURMA: Oh, cool.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.850
Not obscured.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.170
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So I'm
going to try the hack now

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.730
where I'm going to put
the button over there,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.470
and I'm going to
change the opacity.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.100
And as soon as I change the
opacity, it's like, nah.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.610
SURMA: Can't tell
for sure, I guess.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.460
They're being conservative
about this, aren't they?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.918
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Absolutely,
and that's what the aim of this

00:09:05.918 --> 00:09:09.050
is right now is it doesn't
care so much if there's

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.610
false positives.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.853
They don't want false negatives.

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:14.270
It wants to play
on the safe side.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.970
SURMA: So they want to basically
have 100% success rate of--

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.250
they want to get all
the obscured cases

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.790
at the cost of maybe saying
you're obscured when you're not

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:23.670
actually obscured.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.030
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yep.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.330
Yep.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.372
And the same goes for
other things, like filters.

00:09:26.372 --> 00:09:28.590
So if I bring the blur here--

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.090
SURMA: No.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.010
JAKE ARCHIBALD: As soon as
it's blurred to any degree--

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.302
because you don't know what
that button actually means,

00:09:33.302 --> 00:09:35.810
but it knows that it's
being messed around with.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.890
And same here.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.057
As soon as there's an
intersection, it's like, nope.

00:09:39.057 --> 00:09:41.265
So you can't do the trick
where you encourage someone

00:09:41.265 --> 00:09:42.240
to click there.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.280
And one thing I thought
was quite nice--

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.830
and I'm going to
move that to there--

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.960
if I apply some
blur to this, you'll

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.093
see eventually, eventually, as
it gets blurry, it triggers it.

00:09:52.093 --> 00:09:53.510
SURMA: Oh, because
there's a tiny,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.998
little blur overlapping into--

00:09:54.998 --> 00:09:56.540
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes,
so it's not just

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.950
intersecting at a layout level.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.540
It's intersecting
at a paint level.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.650
SURMA: That's really good.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.608
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And that's
because this element

00:10:02.608 --> 00:10:04.085
is appearing on top.

00:10:04.085 --> 00:10:05.960
But as soon as I make
that one appear on top,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.025
it's fine, because
it's on the top level.

00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:09.440
SURMA: Cool.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.620
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah,
that's really it.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.160
SURMA: That's
really interesting.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.820
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And it's
designed to detect things like

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.805
clip-path, scrolling,
anything that would be--

00:10:18.805 --> 00:10:19.930
SURMA: Yeah, I'm guessing--

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:20.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.885
SURMA: --they
spend a lot of time

00:10:21.885 --> 00:10:24.650
going through all the possible
ways you can mess around

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.070
with obscuring and hiding
and pretending to be there

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.280
when you're actually not.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.113
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
there's more work to do.

00:10:31.113 --> 00:10:32.570
It's still a work in progress.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.680
I filed a few bugs
recently where

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.763
I found someone's like,
oh, I can actually do this

00:10:35.763 --> 00:10:36.993
and it doesn't realize.

00:10:36.993 --> 00:10:38.660
So those will be fixed
before launching.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.155
But the idea is we can start
bringing back this behavior

00:10:41.155 --> 00:10:43.280
that we used to have before
we figured out it was--

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.155
SURMA: Actual compatible,
composable widgets.

00:10:45.155 --> 00:10:46.988
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah,
so you can click Like,

00:10:46.988 --> 00:10:49.128
it will actually work,
or even a Buy Now button,

00:10:49.128 --> 00:10:50.420
and it will do the right thing.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.950
SURMA: You know that you can
detect if this is legit click

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.450
or not.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.450
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.880
And that's the
important detail is

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.466
the owner of the button
knows what's happening to it.

00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:03.020
SURMA: So it's still the
responsibility of the embeddee

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.977
to make sure the click is legit.

00:11:04.977 --> 00:11:05.810
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.060
SURMA: But now they can
at a reliable level,

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.910
because before this was
practically impossible,

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.190
no way to tell if there was
content on top, I think.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.790
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.748
Yes, there was no way of
doing this beforehand.

00:11:15.748 --> 00:11:16.890
This is entirely new.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.100
SURMA: So you said this
is in Canary right now.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.600
JAKE ARCHIBALD: In
Canary right now.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.990
SURMA: Do we have any
signals from other people?

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.140
I feel like this is something
that, historically, Apple

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.540
would be interested in, in
securing these kind of things

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.150
on the web.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.030
JAKE ARCHIBALD: There's
definitely interest.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.732
It's something that the owners
of these kind of buttons

00:11:35.732 --> 00:11:36.690
are very interested in.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.815
SURMA: Yeah, I can imagine.

00:11:37.815 --> 00:11:40.103
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So it's
sort of popular with them.

00:11:40.103 --> 00:11:42.520
Right now, I think the other
browsers are happy for Chrome

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.080
to experiment and to prove
that the API can actually work,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.750
can be done, and be fast,
because you don't want just

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.178
using this API to break
the performance of the web.

00:11:51.178 --> 00:11:51.970
SURMA: That's true.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And that's
what we're working on now.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.130
I have no more content.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.520
It's all done.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.300
That's it.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.280
This sheet of paper, done!

00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.790
That was it.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:00.610
SURMA: Tablet, done!

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.902
JAKE ARCHIBALD: What did you
want, another half an hour

00:12:02.902 --> 00:12:04.020
episode?

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.730
SURMA: Yeah, tell
me about something.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.870
He doesn't say cut.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.870
What do we do?
