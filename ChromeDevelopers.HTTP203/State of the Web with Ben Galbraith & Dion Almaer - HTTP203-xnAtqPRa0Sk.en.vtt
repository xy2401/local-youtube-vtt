00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.930
BEN GALBRAITH: I
think you're taking

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.300
sort of intense literal
logic and applying it

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.310
to a colloquial situation
that has everything

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.250
to do with tradition and nothing
to do with literal truth,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.010
right?

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.930
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.755
SURMA: Who are you and why?

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:17.505
DION ALMAER: Nice.

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:18.767
Do you want to go first?

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:19.250
BEN GALBRAITH: I'd
rather you did.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.910
DION ALMAER: Oh, thank you.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.440
My name is Dion Almaer.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.340
The "why" is an interesting one.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.790
So I've worked with this
guy for a long time, lots

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.650
of different companies.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.929
Way back in the day, we did
this thing called Ajaxian.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.220
There's this thing called Ajax.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.954
You are too young to know it.

00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:34.870
JAKE: I remember Ajax.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.730
I am not young enough.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.230
DION ALMAER: And
that was really fun

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.940
to kind of see the
web kind of come back

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.280
and go from docs to
apps and the like.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.300
So I've been living in
the web for a long time.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.000
Used to be at Google.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.100
I'm now back at
Google, running DevRel

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.880
for a few different
teams across the web--

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.945
Android Assistant
and other things.

00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:57.570
What about you?

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.403
BEN GALBRAITH: Yeah.

00:00:58.403 --> 00:01:00.310
So I'm Ben Galbraith.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.180
I am on the Chrome team.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.590
I lead product for the folks
who are working on the web

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.330
platforms, so the
folks who are thinking

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.680
about how the web works on
your web page and things.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.161
JAKE: We've been doing these
interview things all day.

00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:14.910
SURMA: We've never
done interviews before.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.380
JAKE: Yeah, and we
missed your talk.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.820
BEN GALBRAITH: So
we open the talk

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.260
just by showing that
PWAs are everywhere.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.620
And PWAs-- it's fair to
ask what the heck that is.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.500
Basically, the web has
been evolving dramatically

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.890
over the past few years.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.969
And it's been getting a
ton of new capabilities.

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.510
And it's a whole
new platform than it

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.430
used to be just four
or five years ago.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.810
And so we shared a lot
of data around this.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.250
And there's two categories.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.724
One is what's actually
changed about the web.

00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:43.140
And the other is
what happens when

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.910
people take advantage of
the new capabilities that

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.560
are on the web.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.280
And we shared a bunch
of case studies.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.350
Getting to the capability
side, the big one

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.240
is this thing called
Service Worker, which--

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.520
JAKE: I've heard of it.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.040
BEN GALBRAITH: Have you?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.560
JAKE: Go on.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.840
BEN GALBRAITH: Have you?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.969
Let me explain it to you
in very simple terms--

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:57.510
JAKE: Oh, OK.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.310
BEN GALBRAITH: So that
you can understand.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.685
But it's like
forever, everyone's

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:03.920
understood the web is pages,
pages that the browser requests

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.020
and renders.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.370
And Service Worker is the
first major new primitive

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.199
on the web that
changes the game.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.150
Because with Service
Worker, you now

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.110
have this code that's
resident in the browser.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.568
It can receive events from the
site, even when the user has

00:02:16.568 --> 00:02:17.246
left the page.

00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:18.870
You can use it to
override the network.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.460
I love how you guys are
critiquing my explanation

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.010
in real time.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.960
JAKE: It's actually
really good so far.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.454
BEN GALBRAITH: But
yeah, it lets you

00:02:26.454 --> 00:02:28.620
as a developer take control
of the networking stack,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.070
which seems like a--

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.320
why would you want to do that?

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.559
But it's super
important, because there

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.100
are a lot of people
using the web who

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.267
have intermittent connectivity
where it just drops out

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:39.100
or it's really slow.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.740
And so as a developer,
you're in the driver's seat.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.198
It doesn't show
you the dyno screen

00:02:42.198 --> 00:02:43.440
if there a there's a problem.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.600
You can create these
really smooth experiences.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.266
DION ALMAER: I feel
like this time, too,

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:49.347
we actually talked about
the Google properties

00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:50.680
they're actually using this for.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.080
BEN GALBRAITH: Oh, that's right.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.220
That's right.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.320
Let me wrap up Service
Worker real quick.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.020
Because the big news is
that it's finally in Safari.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.210
And it hasn't been
for a long time.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.590
And it's finally in Edge.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.840
But yeah, you were talking
about some other stuff too.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.550
DION ALMAER: Like Google
Search actually using

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.210
the Service Worker--

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.230
got to talk about that today--

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.270
50% less JavaScript.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.810
BEN GALBRAITH:
Yeah, that's right.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.450
DION ALMAER: All the
intermittent things.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.540
You can do a search,
you're offline.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.340
When you come back
online, do the search.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.900
Pop back-- hey, you
want the results?

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.150
BEN GALBRAITH: So we shared
a bunch of these examples.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.430
And then we had, I think,
some pretty exciting new stuff

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.930
to share.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.900
I think stuff that's
new for a lot of people.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.210
The problem with the web is
that it's out in the open.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.160
So for insiders--

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.790
SURMA: What a problem.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.320
BEN GALBRAITH: There's really
not a lot of new things to say,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.850
and if there is, that's
a problem, right?

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.641
Because we don't control
the web at Google.

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:30.655
So we're not going to
have this brand new thing.

00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:33.030
But we are highlighting a lot
of the recent developments,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.786
one of which is this
thing called desktop PWAs.

00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:36.285
SURMA: Yes.

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:37.170
JAKE: Oh.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.336
BEN GALBRAITH: This is cool.

00:03:38.336 --> 00:03:40.560
We showed how Spotify
is using desktop PWA.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.310
So you go to their site,
and you can install it

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.130
to your launcher, in
this case in Chrome OS,

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.110
and it gets its own
top level window.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.170
So alt tab now
works with websites.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.940
JAKE: Oh, so good.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.481
BEN GALBRAITH: It's
fantastic, right?

00:03:54.481 --> 00:03:57.150
JAKE: And I'm glad we
did that on mobile first.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.382
But it there was a
missing piece that we

00:03:59.382 --> 00:04:00.465
couldn't do it on desktop.

00:04:00.465 --> 00:04:01.620
BEN GALBRAITH: Productivity
on the web is a big deal.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.090
We talk about mobile,
mobile, mobile-- and mobile's

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.870
super important.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.885
But there's billions of
people on the desktop.

00:04:06.885 --> 00:04:08.340
But the other thing
is using a lot

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.810
of these popular
productivity apps

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.640
as top level windows
on Chrome OS.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.450
Because that's where it is now.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.620
We're bringing it
to Windows and Mac.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.880
But it's not there yet.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.769
SURMA: I felt like
that lots of companies

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.370
doing their apps in an Electron
shows that there was a desire

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.589
to do that.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.075
To write web and
just have it as if it

00:04:24.075 --> 00:04:25.200
wasn't all on the computer.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.250
BEN GALBRAITH: Let me
talk to you about AutoCAD.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.830
Because AutoCAD-- they
created a web version

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.070
of their application, which
is like kind of mind-blowing.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.630
You go to a lot of
analyst speeches,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.490
and the intelligent analysts
are up there going like,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.198
well, a lot of stuff's
come into the web,

00:04:37.198 --> 00:04:38.865
but old applications
like AutoCAD

00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:40.240
will never come
to the web, or it

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.880
will take them a really long--

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.450
It's here.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.230
They actually
shipped it in March.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.950
That's right.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.020
And I said, oh,
AutoCAD's been innovating

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.150
a ton since it's shipped.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.930
So it's actually
pretty cutting edge.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.600
But they brought their
C++ codebase to the web.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.910
JAKE: So it's just
something great, right?

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.391
So kind of like job done.

00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:56.890
We can relax for
the next few years.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.350
DION ALMAER: Can I
take the negative side?

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.850
JAKE: Oh.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.412
SURMA: Oh.

00:04:59.412 --> 00:05:01.370
BEN GALBRAITH: OK, I
think we're done here now.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.700
JAKE: Wrap it up.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.600
DION ALMAER: I think
the interesting thing

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.860
about the state of
the web, like they're

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.160
talking about, like
everything that's going on,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.010
all the good things.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.660
But that's not the entire
web that you actually

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.810
experience every day.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.476
And we want to keep
adding capabilities,

00:05:15.476 --> 00:05:18.030
and we want to keep bringing
Electron back to the web,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.240
and Cordova back to the
web, and all these things.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.960
How do we get--

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.590
SURMA: The long tail.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.800
DION ALMAER: --all of
the long tail in there.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.216
And that's why we
do a lot of work

00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:27.200
with the Wordpresses and
all these different CMSs.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.100
How can we effect
that long tail?

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.183
SURMA: Yeah, what does the
new capabilities matter

00:05:31.183 --> 00:05:32.309
if nobody uses them, right?

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:33.724
DION ALMAER: And
I feel like we're

00:05:33.724 --> 00:05:35.290
kind of unlocking
both at the moment.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.640
BEN GALBRAITH: That's
where AMP comes in, too.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.050
Because a lot of the keynote
was talking about AMP

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.940
because the web platform
has a ton of capabilities.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.820
But it's also become
a little complex.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.070
I mean, I don't know
if you've noticed.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.210
SURMA: You don't say.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.690
BEN GALBRAITH: It can be hard
to figure out how to do it.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.600
And so AMP is all
about how can we

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.860
make the web really easy for
a set of really targeted use

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.350
cases with an
opinionated approach?

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.630
And it's been maybe a
little controversial.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.342
And this year, we did
a couple of things

00:06:01.342 --> 00:06:02.300
that I'm excited about.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.180
One is that we announced
that we're fixing

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.560
the problem with AMP URLs.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.440
And if you don't know
what that issue is--

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.437
JAKE: I can guess.

00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:11.270
BEN GALBRAITH: It's
this double-edged sword,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.010
where AMP does this
cool thing, where

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.967
it hosts content on this server
that optimizes it and shrinks

00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:18.050
images and all this stuff.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.377
But it's hosted on that server.

00:06:20.377 --> 00:06:22.460
SURMA: I always understood
why they were doing it.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.016
But still the artifact
of the URL was just--

00:06:26.016 --> 00:06:27.140
BEN GALBRAITH: So annoying.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.220
And it's annoying to everybody.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.440
Some people look at
the URL, and they

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.120
think we're trying to move the
whole internet onto our origin,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.539
onto our domain, which is
not at all what we want.

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.080
So there's this new
emerging standard

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.670
called web packaging,
which on itself could be

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.920
the subject of a conversation.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.400
I'm super excited about it.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.430
But from a high
level, what it does--

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.500
it lets you, as a
developer, take your site

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.379
and effectively wrap it in a
secure envelope and just say--

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:49.670
SURMA: You might say a package.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.753
BEN GALBRAITH: A package--

00:06:50.753 --> 00:06:52.010
maybe a better metaphor.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.970
And it doesn't matter
where it comes from.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.560
It's advertised as though
it came from your origin.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.560
And so you can imagine--

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.602
SURMA: Right.

00:06:57.602 --> 00:06:57.710
It's the magic of certificates.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.860
BEN GALBRAITH: --a
browser of the future

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.530
that's more like peer-to-peer.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.946
So if you're in this area where
you can't actually get to,

00:07:02.946 --> 00:07:05.367
let's say, "The New York
Times," if any peer has

00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:07.700
a version of "The New York
Times," that's fairly recent,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.140
you can get it
from them, creating

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.580
this really
decentralized networking

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.350
thing which is at the heart
of the original spirit

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.016
of the internet.

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.990
Anyway, so AMP's able
to use web packaging.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.827
And it's an emerging
standard, we'll see.

00:07:16.827 --> 00:07:18.410
The other thing that
I'm excited about

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.890
is that we've announced that
AMP is embracing web standards

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.170
and things like the Chrome
User Experience Report

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.680
so that we'll be able to use the
actual performance of web pages

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.402
to decide whether
or not they're fast.

00:07:29.402 --> 00:07:31.610
JAKE: So that's what gives
it the little icon, right?

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.700
BEN GALBRAITH: Today you see
that icon if something's AMP.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.914
And moving forward,
we've shared our intent

00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:39.080
to use things like the
Chrome User Experience Report

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.729
and other things as
the canonical indicator

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:44.270
for whether or not something is
going to perform really well.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.660
DION ALMAER: We always saw
that performance with AMP,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.120
but there's the privacy
preservation piece that it has,

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.400
too.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.250
BEN GALBRAITH:
Yeah, that's right.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.166
DION ALMAER: If I go in,
I'm in an aggregator.

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:54.410
If I prefetch or start pinging
over to this other server, then

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.830
all of a sudden Dion the
user can be on the search

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.050
and JakeArchibald.com
knows something

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.370
and has set a cookie on me.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.690
And that's kind of weird.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.210
JAKE: Without you ever
clicking on that link.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:04.850
DION ALMAER: Without
me ever knowing.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.880
Yeah, exactly.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.140
So by having it somewhere
else on Google servers,

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.940
or whatever AMP cache
it's on, we can hide that.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.180
And now with Web Packaging,
it's baked into the platform.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.700
So that's really
exciting, I think.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.960
JAKE: So what do you
think the web needs

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.880
to do within the next
10 years to survive?

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.755
DION ALMAER: I mean,
there's the foundations,

00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:23.960
and there's the real
future future self, right?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.330
Foundationally, we just need
to fix the performance problem

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.690
on the web, just focus in on
getting people using the web.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.674
BEN GALBRAITH: I mean, the web
is this fantastic treasure.

00:08:35.674 --> 00:08:38.090
I feel like if you look at it,
what do we have in the web?

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.260
We have this open ecosystem
where the standards can

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.820
be implemented on any platform.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.070
Think about that for a second.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.660
Because most other platforms
use their ecosystem

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.850
as a walled garden
to block other people

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.460
and to chain people
in that ecosystem.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.200
The web is totally open.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.000
We've got this
inherent index ability

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.583
so you can go through
and discover it.

00:08:57.583 --> 00:09:00.350
You don't have a single
gatekeeper or toll collector.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.570
These are just fantastic
attributes of the web.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.370
SURMA: One of my first talk as a
Googler is I was using a slide,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.510
but I opened a website
on a Nintendo DS.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.160
I was like, that's really a
unique feature of a platform

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.190
that can write a website, and
suddenly it is in your car

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.256
or on your phone
on a Nintendo DS.

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:17.630
BEN GALBRAITH:
But I think, Jake,

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.747
the web is worth
having in society.

00:09:20.747 --> 00:09:21.330
JAKE: I agree.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.827
SURMA: That's an understatement.

00:09:22.827 --> 00:09:24.410
BEN GALBRAITH: But
I think when you're

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.493
talking about 10 years,
what I'm really focused on

00:09:26.493 --> 00:09:30.230
is how can we make sure that the
web remains the platform where

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.072
developers can bring
their best experiences?

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.280
Because I think there's a
lot of competing platforms.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.310
Some of them can do a
better job at animations

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.930
and visual effects on the web--

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:39.770
maybe.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:40.850
I don't know if that's
a fair statement.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.474
DION ALMAER: But not
10 years from now.

00:09:42.474 --> 00:09:44.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.390
JAKE: Two years from now.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.437
SURMA: One year from now?

00:09:46.437 --> 00:09:48.770
BEN GALBRAITH: So we've got
to make sure developers have

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.420
the capabilities they need.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.030
We've got to make sure that
users actually prefer the web.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.696
And we've got to make
sure that browsers

00:09:54.696 --> 00:09:56.164
are where computing is moving.

00:09:56.164 --> 00:09:58.580
And when you think about that
frame, we have a lot of work

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.220
to do.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.230
I feel like developers--
we've got to do a lot.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.786
Houdini is one of my
favorite projects.

00:10:03.786 --> 00:10:05.160
JAKE: The second
Service Workers.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.880
BEN GALBRAITH: There's a lot of
additional stuff we need to do.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.296
So when you talk
about 10 years, I

00:10:09.296 --> 00:10:10.970
want to see the
web platform evolve

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.256
to have more capabilities.

00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:14.130
I don't want to see us
chasing that platform.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.005
So I don't want to see
us advertising the web

00:10:16.005 --> 00:10:18.390
as it's almost as
good as this platform.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.560
You should develop websites
that are like apps.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.227
That maybe is a
controversial statement.

00:10:22.227 --> 00:10:23.601
You were going to
say the web has

00:10:23.601 --> 00:10:24.970
its own unique flavors, right?

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.820
SURMA: It has its own unique
capabilities and use cases,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.420
where--

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:28.930
BEN GALBRAITH: That's right.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.130
SURMA: Like, there is
still use where I say,

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.890
no, that's a use case
for a native platform.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.000
That's not something you
want to solve on the web.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.730
BEN GALBRAITH: I
couldn't agree more.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.850
I think if what you as a
developer want to build

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.224
is something that
feels like it's

00:10:38.224 --> 00:10:40.830
an extension of some
specific operating system,

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.595
it's a native app.

00:10:41.595 --> 00:10:43.720
And you'd be kind of crazy
to use the web for that.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.910
But if you want to engage
with the most users

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.950
you can, if you want
to do it in a way that

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.200
gives the user the best
experience in terms

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.720
of getting something done and
being able to have sessions

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.566
that span devices and things
like that, that's the web.

00:10:55.566 --> 00:10:57.190
That's what the web
should be good for.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.190
JAKE: Someone came up to me and
asked me for a selfie before.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.780
I was over the moon.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.005
But then he said, thank
you very much for Facebook.

00:11:05.005 --> 00:11:07.006
He thought I was
Mark Zuckerberg.

00:11:07.006 --> 00:11:08.506
DION ALMAER: I think
it is the blue.

00:11:08.506 --> 00:11:09.360
BEN GALBRAITH: It's the blue.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.110
JAKE: It says, JS.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.990
What?

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.350
SURMA: It's probably
also the face.
