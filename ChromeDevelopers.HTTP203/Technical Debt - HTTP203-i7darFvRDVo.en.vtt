00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.510
SPEAKER 1: One of the things
I've been thinking about

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.926
is we haven't
discussed what we're

00:00:02.926 --> 00:00:04.420
going to call this series.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.090
SPEAKER 2: I would
just say HTTP203.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.486
SPEAKER 1: But it's different
because we've got people.

00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:09.380
EVA: Yeah.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.012
People-- like real people,
not like humanoids.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.904
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.290
SPEAKER 2: Welcome.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.000
Who are you and why?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.430
EVA: Oh.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.930
Can I start with
the "why" question?

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.584
[LAUGHS]

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:25.250
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.875
Go on then.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:26.375
Go on then.

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:26.875
EVA: No.

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:30.600
So I'm Eva, and I work at
developer relations for Chrome.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.900
And I'm here at I/O to
enjoy the beautiful weather

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.940
and other participants and
also to give talks and interact

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.580
with people--

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.900
a lot interact with people.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.650
SPEAKER 2: I know.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.360
It's a lot of
interaction, isn't it?

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.410
EVA: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.860
By the end of the
day, my introvert self

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.135
tries to hide inside.

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:50.760
But actually, it's
very worthy as well.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.420
It's critical.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.045
SPEAKER 2: It's like
I really enjoy it.

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:55.410
But I also need to recuperate
a lot afterwards usually.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.830
SPEAKER 1: It's a weird
part of this job, isn't it,

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.121
that we take people who are
traditionally introverted--

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.000
I think we'd all include
ourselves in that--

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and we go, what are we
going to do for a living?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.150
Oh, we'll go on stage.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.020
SPEAKER 2: Talk to
people all the time.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.350
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.750
And it's just all of the energy
just sapped away at once,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.257
and then we have to go
and lie in a coffin.

00:01:12.257 --> 00:01:13.590
SPEAKER 2: Fetal position, yeah.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.700
SPEAKER 1: Fetal
position in a coffin.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.491
SPEAKER 2: [LAUGHS]

00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:17.600
EVA: Like you see,
it's a bit difficult--

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.910
totally different if you
talk to a group of extroverts

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.350
and you hang out
with extroverts.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.683
With introverts, it's different.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:26.190
Like, we just say hi, hi, and
everybody goes their own way.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.570
And everybody is OK with that.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.060
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.520
That's the thing, like you
said in the circle, all

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.179
looking at you.

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.720
EVA: But people
understand, you know?

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.410
SPEAKER 1: So one of the things
that I encounter at these kind

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.560
of events-- because I walk past
people I sort of vaguely know

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.845
or have met before--

00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:41.910
and we'll walk past
each other and go,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.810
hey, Mike, and hey, Jake.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.284
And now we're locked in.

00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:47.450
And it's that sort of thing.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.430
It's like, do you want
to go for a picnic?

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.095
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:51.970
What's the next step?

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.875
SPEAKER 2: I thought
it was the thing where

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:54.900
you pretend you haven't seen
the other person-- you just

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.410
keep walking.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.280
You just look at your
feet, and you're like--

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.580
SPEAKER 1: Oh.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.660
So you're trying
to avoid people.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.284
That works too.

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:01.050
SPEAKER 2: I have
been guilty of that.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.090
Some days when I'm too
low energy, and I'm like,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.860
oh, that's a person.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.443
SPEAKER 1: No.

00:02:04.443 --> 00:02:07.030
I'm happy with the
meeting and the talking.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.477
But it's when to break it off,
and what's the rule there?

00:02:09.477 --> 00:02:10.310
Like you would say--

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.062
EVA: Oh, just say,
oh, I have a thing.

00:02:12.062 --> 00:02:13.020
SPEAKER 2: Oh, a thing.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.272
SPEAKER 1: That's really good.

00:02:14.272 --> 00:02:15.480
EVA: The magical thing, yeah.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.260
SPEAKER 1: I've got a thing.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.260
SPEAKER 2: With a thing.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.430
EVA: And I'm so glad that
Googlers go ahead of our needs.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.040
Have you seen the demo with
the phone call, where the AI is

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.240
doing a phone call for you?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.400
SPEAKER 2: In the
future, we can just

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.630
send that to the conference.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.560
SPEAKER 1: [LAUGHS]

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.410
EVA: One thing is that all
this technology behind it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.960
is so amazing and everything.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.450
But what amazes me the
most is that [GASPS]

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.080
there must be so many
introverts in the world

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.530
if they made a technology
for people like me.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.920
I finally feel
included, you know?

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.010
SPEAKER 2: So what
have you been doing?

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.180
What, why-- what have
you've been talking about?

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.320
SPEAKER 1: What, what, why?

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.100
SPEAKER 2: What, why--

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.480
well, we already had
one why question.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.604
SPEAKER 1: What, what, why?

00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:56.780
EVA: Well, it started that
we built an app with Adi,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.610
and it was crap.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.216
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:59.216 --> 00:03:00.716
SPEAKER 1: But that
was Adi's fault.

00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:01.320
That was Adi's fault, right?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.410
EVA: No.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.450
It was an amazing app.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.710
You could go and
check Google doodles,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.330
and you could play
them, and it was

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.650
all super interactive and nice.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.400
But it was just not performant.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.240
And when you do stuff
with Adi and folks,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.500
it needs to be performant.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.400
So they made us fix it, and
we learned quite a bit out

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.120
of that.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.330
So we've been sharing
that throughout the talk.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.720
It's actually much easier to
run into performance troubles

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.010
than we originally thought.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.510
So yeah.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.505
SPEAKER 2: [LAUGHS] Oh,
that's a different one.

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:28.810
EVA: Ta-da.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.226
SPEAKER 2: Well, we
definitely mention your talk

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:30.770
in the description.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.470
EVA: It's pretty
easy to make a--

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.430
SPEAKER 1: What kind
of performance problems

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.630
were you hitting then?

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.150
EVA: Well, a lot of
stuff comes from the fact

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.215
that when you develop things, it
lasts over some period of time.

00:03:41.215 --> 00:03:42.840
And after some time,
you don't remember

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.380
what you did before, and so on.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.570
So things accumulate, right?

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.320
And then you just forget.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.297
And we've been working with some
tools that help you remind--

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:51.630
SPEAKER 2: There's your mistake.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.567
EVA: --what might go wrong.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.650
Yeah, if there were no
tools, everybody was happy.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.060
Nobody had any scores, right?

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.847
But now, there are tools
that can reminds you of--

00:04:00.847 --> 00:04:02.430
for example, I don't
know, the library

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.877
you forgot to kick out because
you're not using it anymore--

00:04:06.877 --> 00:04:09.210
about the images that are
twice as big because you said,

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.380
OK, I'll optimize them
later, and this later just

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.910
never happened.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.330
So it's all about process.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.079
It's less about the
code, and the samples,

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.200
and the techniques
you use in the code.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.250
It's more about the
process, like how

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.940
to fit your performance
habits into your overall--

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.595
SPEAKER 2: So how big of a role
does Lighthouse play in that?

00:04:27.595 --> 00:04:28.970
Is that something
where you think

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.400
triaging if Lighthouse reminds
you of everything that it

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.500
needs to remind you of.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.430
EVA: There are
new audits running

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.990
each quarter in
lighthouse, and it's

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.900
getting better and better job
of giving you just an overview

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.739
of what you could be improving.

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.780
And that's pretty neat,
because usually you don't

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.880
want to improve everything.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.255
You just need to
pick and choose.

00:04:46.255 --> 00:04:47.970
So if you have a
whole list, you can go

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.801
and say, OK, apparently, this
one, this one, and this one

00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:51.300
is cheap.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.410
So I'll do it now.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.130
And this one and this
one are important.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.960
So I do it now.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.010
And these are expensive
and not so important.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.800
So I just ignore them.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.450
So it's getting better.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.550
And it's really a good guidance.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.510
It can lead you
through that process.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.110
SPEAKER 1: So what
were the issues

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.820
that you punted until later on?

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.686
What was the stuff
that was going

00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:15.810
to be really complex to
solve versus the stuff that

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.812
was really easy?

00:05:16.812 --> 00:05:18.770
EVA: Well generally, you
want to add a feature,

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.987
like you want to have
some images on the page,

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.820
and you want to land
it as soon as possible.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.028
So you add the feature, and
you forget to optimize it

00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:26.940
at the same time.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.270
So it's like the stuff--

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.630
if you don't do it, great at
the beginning, straight away.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.779
You say, OK, I'll do it first
initial version, agile style,

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:38.820
and then I'll come back
later and make it better.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.850
This later might never happen
because, for example, you're

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.190
preparing for a Goggle I/O
or something like that.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.990
SPEAKER 1: Oh, yes.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.560
So is there a difference
between working

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.300
towards performance
stuff versus working

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.460
on features because you've
been doing sort of both, right?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.626
EVA: Yeah, that's the thing.

00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:57.320
So we decided to write this
app without taking performance

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.830
much into consideration and see
how it is to retroactively go

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.595
back and fix those things.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:03.845
That was the kind of exercise.

00:06:03.845 --> 00:06:05.180
SPEAKER 2: It's
probably very realistic,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.310
because I think most teams
work and, like, let's

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.812
get the functionality
first and optimize later.

00:06:09.812 --> 00:06:11.270
SPEAKER 1: Oh, but
then it puts you

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.250
in danger of not
doing that last step.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.610
SPEAKER 2: I know but--

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.810
SPEAKER 1: It's like, oh, we'll
do accessibility at the end,

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.210
and then people go, oh,
the project's over-running.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.109
Let's cut it there.

00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:20.150
SPEAKER 2: But also that's
people throwing around

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.980
the whole thing-- you know,
premature optimization

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.000
is the root of all evil.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.590
So you have people
actually trying

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.220
to follow all this
conflicting advice.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.845
EVA: I mean, of course
it's really good

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:31.280
to start with designing
for performance first.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.960
And it really leads
to great results.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.990
But I mean, sometimes
it does not happen.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.073
If you have a lot of
[INAUDIBLE] in your project--

00:06:38.073 --> 00:06:40.670
you have your boss, you
have your marketing team,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:46.010
you have other folks, and
you need to juggle that.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.710
And sometimes you are
realistically in this state

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.342
where you have an
app, and you want

00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:51.800
to make it more
performant, and you

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.060
need to do retroactive work.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.610
So we just wanted to
explore that a little bit

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.190
and see if Lighthouse is a
really good tool that can

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.080
lead you to some gains there.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.030
And apparently it is.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.510
SPEAKER 2: So when you
were developing this app,

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.000
did you basically give
feedback to the Lighthouse team

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.647
and saying, "this did not get
caught by Lighthouse, fix it,"

00:07:08.647 --> 00:07:09.230
kind of thing?

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.729
EVA: Yeah.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.800
So there were some areas
where we were appointing stuff

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.547
like this.

00:07:13.547 --> 00:07:15.380
And fortunately, most
of the time the answer

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.260
was wait a quarter or two.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.267
It's in progress.

00:07:18.267 --> 00:07:19.100
We're getting there.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.370
We know it will be there soon.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.590
So it's a very dynamically
developed tool.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.679
SPEAKER 1: So you've been
in the Sandbox as well.

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:27.220
EVA: Oh yeah.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.330
SPEAKER 1: The area of I/O
where we've got all of the apps.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.450
EVA: They have speakers there.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.033
SPEAKER 2: Why is
it called a Sandbox,

00:07:32.033 --> 00:07:33.116
because it's not like--

00:07:33.116 --> 00:07:34.490
when I think of
"sandbox," either

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.750
it's an actual box of sand.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.071
Or it's like a metaphor for
where you go to build things.

00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:41.320
But that's also not happening.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.820
EVA: No, no.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.530
It's about faces.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.320
Have you seen kids going
into the sandbox and the face

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.117
they make at that
point, like pure joy.

00:07:47.117 --> 00:07:47.700
SPEAKER 2: Oh.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.283
SPEAKER 1: Well, in
England we call it

00:07:49.283 --> 00:07:51.240
a sandpit, which sounds like--

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.687
it sounds like
where you might die.

00:07:53.687 --> 00:07:54.770
It's a different between--

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:55.645
EVA: It's like arena?

00:07:55.645 --> 00:07:58.820
SPEAKER 1: --put your kid in the
sandpit [HISSING] kid's gone.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.480
Never mind.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.213
SPEAKER 2: Well,
it's not quicksand.

00:08:02.213 --> 00:08:02.796
SPEAKER 1: No.

00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:03.546
Well, do you know?

00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:04.814
SPEAKER 2: A quicksand pit.

00:08:04.814 --> 00:08:05.710
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.990
Well, I had a
sandpit growing up.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.560
But we also had cats.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.203
So the sandpit was
not a fun place to be.

00:08:13.203 --> 00:08:13.704
EVA: Ooh.

00:08:13.704 --> 00:08:15.744
SPEAKER 1: So when people
are saying the sandbox,

00:08:15.744 --> 00:08:18.250
that's all I'm thinking of is
oh, it's going to be full of--

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.375
EVA: It depends on your
definition of fun, I guess.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:21.032
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:21.032 --> 00:08:22.490
SPEAKER 1: In the
north of England,

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.990
we'll take any fun we get.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.670
Like, oh, modeling clay--

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.410
no.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.712
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:28.712 --> 00:08:30.170
So who have you
been meeting there?

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.419
What kind of things
have you been doing?

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.887
EVA: I've met quite a few
of Google developer experts.

00:08:34.887 --> 00:08:37.220
And it's pretty cool, because
they have so much passion,

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.090
and they usually specialize
in some narrow area.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.930
I can't know about every
single nook of web.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.510
So it's always very enlightening
to see all this passion.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.010
SPEAKER 1: But
knowing all about all

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:53.470
of the web, that's something I
remember having to let go of.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.180
We're talking 15
years ago, I kind of

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.525
felt like I knew a
reasonable amount of the web.

00:08:58.525 --> 00:08:59.900
This was kind of
in the IE6 days,

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.557
when the web had
essentially stalled.

00:09:01.557 --> 00:09:03.140
But then new things
we're being added.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.552
So then we started to
get IndexedDB, WebGL

00:09:06.552 --> 00:09:07.510
and that sort of thing.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.630
And I panicked at
first thinking,

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.434
how am I going to
learn all of this?

00:09:11.434 --> 00:09:12.350
EVA: I feel young now.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.058
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:09:13.058 --> 00:09:15.390
But you don't have to
learn all of this, right?

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:15.890
EVA: Yeah.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.830
That's why a lot of people are
choosing their specialization

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.770
path these days, I think.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.240
Web performance is
one possibility.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.500
Other people focus more on
the back end side of things.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.690
I mean, the web is
broad, and there's

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.752
space for all types of
specialists, I guess.

00:09:31.752 --> 00:09:33.960
SPEAKER 2: I mean, that's
where I see part of our job

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.335
most, to try and
figure out which

00:09:35.335 --> 00:09:37.940
APIs are relevant to everyone.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.845
Stuff like, for
example, CSS Grid

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.720
is probably useful to
everyone, and everybody

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.845
should take a look at that.

00:09:42.845 --> 00:09:46.530
SPEAKER 1: It is so useful, and
I feel I only know 1% of it.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.550
And it's so powerful.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.841
SPEAKER 2: That's probably
enough for most of the time.

00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:51.290
And then there is the niches--

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.265
do you really need to
know WebGL or WebUSB.

00:09:55.265 --> 00:09:56.890
You don't if you
don't have a use case.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:57.710
SPEAKER 1: Good,
because I don't know

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:58.834
either of those two things.

00:09:58.834 --> 00:10:00.380
Thank you for
validating my skills.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.177
[LAUGHS]

00:10:01.177 --> 00:10:03.260
SPEAKER 2: And that's
something where we have been

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.250
trying to also get better at--

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.670
and with projects like these,
because in these projects

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.380
you figure out Grit
was useful here,

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.380
and I can see it being
useful in more use cases.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.380
Or you find out I had
to resort to feature

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.890
x, even though I don't
think it should be the case.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.220
Can we do something to make
it easier for developers?

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.970
EVA: I think what is
cool about the web is

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.880
there is a lot of community
around different areas.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.550
And it's not a matter
of being a specialist

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.329
in every single area, so that
you can have a cool project.

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:30.870
It's when you have
a project, and you

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.880
have a particular problem
to solve on that project,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.550
you can go out and
find information

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.680
that is relevant
to you on a given

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.850
particular moment in time.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.600
So as long as this information
is findable, you'll be fine.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.920
You just need to know
how to look for it.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.920
SPEAKER 2: I mean, it's
good, though, that we're

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.090
keeping an eye out--

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.260
to have people like you actually
field test this stuff so that

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:52.965
it doesn't--

00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:55.170
it gets sooner than later.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.540
English is hard today.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.280
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:57.900
EVA: Yeah, told you.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.108
SPEAKER 1: It's getting late.

00:10:59.108 --> 00:11:00.826
EVA: It is-- these
type of things, yeah.
