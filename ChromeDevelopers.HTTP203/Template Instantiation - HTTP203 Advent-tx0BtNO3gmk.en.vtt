00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.280
SURMA: So it's December.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.850
JAKE: Yeah.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.640
SURMA: The last month of 2017.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.661
And usually, we make plans for
the next year, which is 2018.

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:13.160
JAKE: Yes.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.040
SURMA: And so I thought I
would give myself two minutes

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.780
to talk to you about my plans.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.290
JAKE: OK.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.220
What are your plans?

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.940
SURMA: So my plan is the
template proposal from Apple.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.170
JAKE: Oh.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.232
Apple template proposal.

00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:26.690
SURMA: The Apple
template proposal.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.000
JAKE: So what have
they proposed?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.940
So we've already got templates--
things like Mustache,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.760
and Handlebars,
that sort of thing.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.510
SURMA: Yeah, those are
templating engines.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.192
In this case, we're talking
about the template tag in HTML.

00:00:39.192 --> 00:00:40.400
JAKE: That's already shipped.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.399
SURMA: That has shipped.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.100
And it's there, so you can
clone, instantiate, sub--

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.225
like, partial DOM trees
really, really efficiently.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:49.183
JAKE: But otherwise, I've
never really used it.

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:50.675
I just use it as a parser hack.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:50.930
SURMA: Exactly.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.970
And that's kind of what
they want to augment.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.590
They want to add
the capabilities

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.360
of adding bindings.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.510
We know from Mustache, we said,
in this particular position

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.390
in the template, I would like to
use this value from a variable.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.972
JAKE: So how-- we already have,
sort of, a template language

00:01:05.972 --> 00:01:08.430
on the web, because we've got
JavaScript template language.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.472
So what's the difference?

00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:11.263
SURMA: The difference
is that in this case,

00:01:11.263 --> 00:01:13.790
this would be baked very
efficiently into the browser.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.647
It would basically do things
like we talked about hyperHTML,

00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:18.230
and lit-HTML, do
these kind of things,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.160
that it would remember which
bits are actually mutatable.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.890
And then you can just
update the instance

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.272
by giving it a new state
object, which you rip out

00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:29.480
the version it needs, puts
it in the right positions,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.090
and you have an
updated, DOM fragment.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.370
JAKE: Oh, so it is very
much like hyperHTML,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.132
lit-HTML on that.

00:01:35.132 --> 00:01:36.590
SURMA: It seems to
be very similar.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.300
I don't know how
the implementation

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.500
would look under the hood.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.660
But from the
developer's perspective,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.470
it is very similar.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.770
But in this case, you could just
write it in your HTML markup,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.830
rather than to have to wire up--

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.961
import a library, and to use
the HTML tag string template.

00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:53.460
Literal.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.530
JAKE: Literal.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.430
So are other browsers
interested in this?

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.200
SURMA: As far as I
know, the reactions

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.190
were fairly good to it.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.070
It was discussed at
CheapHack, and the proposal's

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.670
out on GitHub.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.930
And everything looked
fairly positive.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.910
There's some kinks that
have to be figured out.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.530
But other than that,
it seems like browsers

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.699
are very much interested.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.530
JAKE: Sounds like a
nice, high-level thing

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.157
to augment web
components and stuff.

00:02:14.157 --> 00:02:15.740
SURMA: For example,
yeah, shutter DOM,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.880
all these sort of things can
make good use of templates.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.090
And I think it's going to
be interesting in 2018.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.600
[8 BIT VERSION OF "THE
TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS"]

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.290
JAKE: Good timing.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.040
And the thing I'm going
to describe to you

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.410
is a flatMap in flatten.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.560
SURMA: What?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.970
JAKE: Good question.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.350
These are methods that
are going to go on arrays.
