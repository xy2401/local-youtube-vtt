00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.970
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Recently I was asked

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.138
to write an article about
the visual viewport API.

00:00:07.138 --> 00:00:08.086
SURMA: Oh.

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:12.210
So I thought of the viewport
as basically the rectangle

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.090
off the top of your entire
document, the subsection

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.970
that you can see.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.260
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.400
SURMA: Right?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.140
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.806
SURMA: OK, good.

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:20.400
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And that was
kind of how things started on

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.499
mobile as well.

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.040
We had that, you know, the idea
of a whole document, and then

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.310
a viewport, which was the
bit you were looking at.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.150
But what Apple decided is
to have this extra viewport.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.740
So when you pinch
zoom in, you're

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.420
now in a viewport (WHISPERING)
inside the viewport.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.896
Du-du-du.

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:37.770
SURMA: That's very Inception-y.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.880
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It is.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.275
SURMA: Uh.

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:43.150
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Wah.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.090
[MUSICAL SOUND EFFECT]

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.300
Surma wins again.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.540
SURMA: I think my
job is done here.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.990
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.780
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
here's the thing.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.320
And this is how a lot
of browsers implemented

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.440
it at first is like
position fixed items

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.230
would sit on the
viewport, right?

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.910
If you positioned
something fixed to top,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.000
it sits wherever you do
that on the viewport.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.750
So you're scrolling
along, it stays fixed.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.373
SURMA: So if you zoom in, it
would still stick to the top

00:01:18.373 --> 00:01:18.660
instead of--

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.120
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It gets bigger.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.520
And, you know,
eventually you can't--

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.750
your positioned, fixed
items, if you have them--

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.820
SURMA: Just cover--

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.278
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Are now taking up--

00:01:26.278 --> 00:01:27.570
right, the whole screen.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.480
And this is something
that I think

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.115
Apple pioneered is the idea
of adding multiple viewports.

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:36.770
And the names we've given
them is the layout viewport

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.765
is the outer one.

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:41.390
And that's what's-- that's kind
of the outer scroll viewport

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.710
of the document.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.254
That's where the position
fixed items will stick to.

00:01:45.254 --> 00:01:46.670
And when you pinch
zoom in, you're

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.080
now in the visual viewport.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.580
SURMA: OK.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.370
So it doesn't mean, though,
that the layout viewport only

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.079
moves vertically?

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.286
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, it can
move horizontally as well.

00:01:55.286 --> 00:01:57.700
SURMA: Because it can still
have a layout that's wider

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.940
than your layout viewport.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.310
So you can still
move both directions.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.010
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Absolutely.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.280
Yeah.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.660
SURMA: Yeah, OK.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.826
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You can
think of the layout viewport

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:07.330
as being the same as the visual
viewport when you're zoomed out

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.979
as far as you can go.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.090
One of the problems that a lot
of mobile browsers had is they

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.910
couldn't decide which viewport
the value should be for.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.300
So one of these ones is
getBoundingClientRect.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.260
Right?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.220
SURMA: Yes, I see.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.380
That would be a problem
because usually those

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.000
are the coordinates of the
rectangle of the object

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.260
that you're calling that
function on "on screen,"

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.285
but now "on screen," right?

00:02:36.285 --> 00:02:37.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Aha, right.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.300
And most browsers agreed
that that was going

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.429
to be to the layout viewport.

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:42.720
So pinch zooming didn't matter.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.235
SURMA: I would tend to agree.

00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:45.780
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.260
But then most browsers
also agreed that scroll top

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.006
would mean the visual viewport.

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:55.760
SURMA: Really?

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.676
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.837
Yeah, exactly.

00:02:57.837 --> 00:02:58.420
And this had--

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.870
SURMA: I would have seen
that the visual viewport's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.080
like a complete
abstract [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.600
Layout viewport implies layout.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.910
And then the visual
viewport is just

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.250
basically a visual trimming
of whatever you laid out.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.250
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.460
And that's what browsers
are now trying to do.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.400
SURMA: Yes.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.780
JAKE ARCHIBALD: They're
trying to get to-- yes,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.406
you've come up with
the correct answer.

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:19.696
Unfortunately, you're too late.

00:03:19.696 --> 00:03:22.300
Other people already got
there and are implementing it.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.550
And this is kind of an agreement
between Chrome and Apple,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.080
and others are agreeing as well.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.080
So one of the things you would
do with getBoundingClientRect

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.297
is you didn't want that
position within the viewport.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.130
You wanted the position
within the document.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.963
SURMA: I was just about
to say, and then you

00:03:37.963 --> 00:03:40.570
need both scroll top and
getBoundingClientRect

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.790
to be layout viewport
because then you

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.170
can just add the two up--

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.330
SURMA: And find the position
within the document, which

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.454
is super important, which
I just recently ran into.

00:03:48.454 --> 00:03:50.410
Because sometimes
you want an element

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.947
to detach from however it's laid
out and position it absolutely

00:03:55.947 --> 00:03:57.155
but relative to the document.

00:03:57.155 --> 00:03:57.545
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:03:57.545 --> 00:03:58.985
Because you want to do an
animation or something.

00:03:58.985 --> 00:03:59.610
SURMA: Exactly.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.360
And that's why you need to be
able to do that kind of math.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.540
I guess if we had
chosen the other way,

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.430
it's all relative to
the visual viewport.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.170
It would have
probably added some

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.579
calls to get to do the
calculations in there,

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.120
but that's unnecessarily
complicated.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.710
So I'm really happy
they went that way.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.710
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But the
web is full of this code

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.269
now that is doing that
getBoundingClientRect

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.465
plus scroll top, which breaks
as soon as you pinch zoom in.

00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:24.090
SURMA: Oh, yes.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.200
True.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.980
We would have broken the web.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.270
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.580
So this is going to-- this move
to making everything the layout

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.470
viewport is actually starting
to fix existing code, which

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.115
is really nice.

00:04:34.115 --> 00:04:34.615
SURMA: Nice.

00:04:34.615 --> 00:04:35.114
Yeah.

00:04:35.114 --> 00:04:37.340
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So the
idea is, like you say, make

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.550
the pinch zooming thing
pretty much entirely

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.380
transparent-- like
not something that is

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.611
reflected in any web APIs.

00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:47.420
SURMA: Is it exposed in any way?

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.570
Can I figure out if
the user is zoomed in?

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.290
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So that's what
the visual viewport API is for.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.700
SURMA: Ha.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.967
[LAUGHING]

00:04:56.967 --> 00:04:57.800
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.660
That is what the visual
viewport API is for.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.205
And it is basically--
the idea is

00:05:01.205 --> 00:05:03.080
that this is going to
be the only place where

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.980
that is exposed.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.790
And it will tell you
the position and scale

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.250
of the visual viewport relative
to the layout viewport.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.083
I think one of the
things it would be useful

00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:13.870
for is when the user zooms in,
get rid of all of the position

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.660
fixed stuff because that is
kind of getting in the way--

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.414
unless that is what the user's
zooming in on, in which case

00:05:19.414 --> 00:05:20.330
that will be annoying.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.800
SURMA: I mean it
just now landed,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.127
so I'm assuming
some best practice

00:05:24.127 --> 00:05:26.210
and explorations are going
to start happening soon

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.080
around that.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.955
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:30.440
And I think it's one
of those extensible web

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.230
things where it's like
it's information we have.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.860
We should be giving
developers it

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.930
and see what they
come up with it.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.638
SURMA: And you can
use it if you need it.

00:05:36.638 --> 00:05:39.200
If not, everything's just going
to behave the same, or better

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.940
now, I guess.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.260
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.960
I mean even to something
like analytics.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.632
So you could, you
know, find out where

00:05:43.632 --> 00:05:44.840
your users are pinch zooming.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.800
You might find on one particular
page, everyone's pinch zooming

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.300
in.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.180
So you can then go and
investigate and go, oh yeah,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.846
these buttons aren't
great or something.

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:53.430
So yeah, that would be one way.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.994
But yeah, that's
the visual viewport.

00:05:55.994 --> 00:05:57.410
And this is something
that I think

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.940
that Apple pioneered is the idea
of adding multiple viewports.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.123
SURMA: Apple pie-oneered?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.936
SURMA: I had to do it.

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.320
I had to do it.
