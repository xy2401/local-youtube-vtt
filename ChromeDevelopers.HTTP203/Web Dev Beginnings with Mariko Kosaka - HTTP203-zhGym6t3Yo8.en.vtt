00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.670
JAKE: We're here with MK.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.270
Hit us with some of the things
that are being announced here

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.409
at I/O today.

00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:09.854
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.660
Who are you and why?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.940
MARIKO KOSAKA: Hi.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.911
I'm Mariko.

00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:22.060
JAKE: You're terrified already.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.360
MARIKO KOSAKA: I'm here
because you DMed me

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.650
that I need to be here.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.941
SURMA: That's actually correct.

00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:28.834
That's the first correct answer.

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:30.750
JAKE: So how is it you
got started in the web,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.180
then, rather than native?

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.220
MARIKO KOSAKA: I just
kind of figured that out.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.630
I grew up in kind of a very
technologically-inclined

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.070
family.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.610
I always had access to a
computer and internet from--

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.360
I don't know-- grade
4 or 5 or something.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.060
It was never like,
oh, this is amazing.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.550
I'm going to code assembly
in my Commodore 64.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.610
And I'm going to be a
programmer situation.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.410
I just hung there around.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.480
And one computer that I had
came with a web authoring

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.326
tool that was made by IBM.

00:01:05.326 --> 00:01:06.700
It came with the
Windows machine.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.270
SURMA: So it wasn't Dreamweaver?

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.470
MARIKO KOSAKA: What?

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.620
SURMA: It wasn't Dreamweaver?

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.470
MARIKO KOSAKA: It
wasn't Dreamweaver.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.140
Dreamweaver was college for me.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.190
JAKE: What was the IBM one then?

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.820
MARIKO KOSAKA: This is the one
called IBM Home Page Builder.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.650
JAKE: Home Page Builder.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.150
Excellent.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.000
MARIKO KOSAKA: I believe it
is developed in IBM Japan--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030
maybe Japan local.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.930
But that was my
first authoring tool.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.760
And it was amazing.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.700
It had a GUI, a very simple GUI.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.530
Because it was back then
when you were designing pages

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.220
with flames and tables.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.000
Making WYSIWYG was a little--

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.971
SURMA: I miss frameset.

00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:39.030
MARIKO KOSAKA: --simpler.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.260
Frameset, yeah.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.170
Menu on the side.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.240
SURMA: Exactly.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.535
I could resize it as a user.

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:44.160
It was amazing.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.530
MARIKO KOSAKA: And then
I think it has a tab

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.870
to open the HTML code.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.710
But back then, it
wasn't complicated.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.600
So as an elementary schooler,
I just kind of figured it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.080
out by just playing with
this web authoring tool.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.470
And then, somehow, I already
had access to internet.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.610
So I must have searched on
the internet or whatever.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.110
I do remember I did
not have Google.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.240
SURMA: Which search
engine did you use?

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.114
MARIKO KOSAKA: I did
not use a search engine.

00:02:13.114 --> 00:02:14.446
It was a directory.

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:16.130
JAKE: Oh, yeah, like
a Yahoo directory.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.220
MARIKO KOSAKA: Yeah.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.684
I was guided to use Yahoo kids.

00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:19.725
Because I was Yahoo kids.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.920
Somehow I found out what
FTP was and signed up

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.920
for free hosting with the ad
banner that comes with it.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.670
Remember the days?

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.170
JAKE: Yeah.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.374
SURMA: Yeah.

00:02:31.374 --> 00:02:32.790
MARIKO KOSAKA: And
then I uploaded

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.650
and started making websites.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.900
JAKE: I think one of the
things that really brought me

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.110
to the web is how quickly you
can get something on screen.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.850
When I try to do--

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.350
I was going to say
real programming.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.664
Let's not say real programming.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.080
Actually, definitely
it felt to me

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.620
at the time real
programming versus whatever

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.994
this new thing was.

00:02:50.994 --> 00:02:52.410
You felt like
you're writing loads

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.576
of code in this other thing.

00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:56.180
And all you were doing
was outputting some text.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.730
Whereas on the web, you're h-1.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.060
Now I've got big
text and fonts, red.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.360
Now I've got red text, marquee.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.440
Now we're talking, right?

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.640
It's going everywhere.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.850
It was that sort of instant
feeling of progress.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.197
SURMA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:11.197 --> 00:03:12.030
MARIKO KOSAKA: Yeah.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.720
And back then, Microsoft Word
had amazing HTML rendering

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.220
engine.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.490
SURMA: Well, you say amazing.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.832
JAKE: Yeah, let's--

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:20.790
SURMA: I used it a lot.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.730
But I also, at some point,
I learned HTML and looked

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.530
into what Word was generating.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.260
MARIKO KOSAKA: Somehow the
magic that tricked me into this

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.500
was I authored HTML file.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.812
Opened it in Microsoft Word
and still acted like website.

00:03:35.812 --> 00:03:38.020
And you can click on the
links and go to the website.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.760
SURMA: That's true.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.510
JAKE: I think it was
a different rendering

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.470
engine to what Explorer did.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.610
It might even have been
different to the one Front

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.010
Page used.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.530
MARIKO KOSAKA: But they
had a support for HTML.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.170
SURMA: Yeah.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.470
I mean, you could also
write a Word document

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.600
with your normal buttons.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.102
Make it bold, make it a heading,
and then save it as HTML.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:56.976
MARIKO KOSAKA: As a--

00:03:56.976 --> 00:04:02.165
I don't know-- fourth, sixth
grader with no friends.

00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:03.790
JAKE: None of us had
friends in school.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.670
MARIKO KOSAKA: Coming
home and then just

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.430
turning on the computer
every day after school.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.160
And that box was
my little world.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.420
It was amazing.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.269
Because my dad was a teacher
at a vocational high school.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.230
He was a technology teacher.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.780
So I had access to
internet quite early on.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.060
So I had an internet friend.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.060
And it wasn't through
a social media thing.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.170
It was somehow randomly maybe
from that directory thing.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.660
I found this one
person's website

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.120
that had the PBS,
the bulletin board.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.310
And it turns out it was--

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.780
we were both girls in
Tokyo in the same grade

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.820
or whatever and savvy
enough to make web pages.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.560
So I would turn on the computer,
do some coding, or drawing,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.320
or whatever.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.210
But then I go to the PBS,
and then I kind of write

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.080
a letter, like, today--

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.620
and we have a very slow--

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.961
JAKE: Are you still in contact?

00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:07.710
MARIKO KOSAKA: No.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.470
No, I don't even remember
what that site was.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.940
SURMA: I actually had
a person when I was 12.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.190
I was a member of a German
Java programming bulletin board

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.920
kind of thing.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.340
MARIKO KOSAKA:
You are so a nerd.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.400
SURMA: I'm still in
contact with that person.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.941
JAKE: Really?

00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:22.395
MARIKO KOSAKA: Java programing.

00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:25.020
JAKE: But you're not supposed to
meet people from the internet.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.785
That's dangerous.

00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:27.660
SURMA: What was the
first messenger you used?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.780
What's it like a
Japanese local version?

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.320
Was it like ICQ or AIM?

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.490
MARIKO KOSAKA: I
think must be AIM.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.640
I wasn't into those little
chat communication things

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.100
when I was in Japan.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.920
It was always a synchronous,
written in bold,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.370
like in a posting to
thread kind of thing,

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.100
which is kind of how
our chat apps are

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.369
getting to be now with threads.

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:56.160
SURMA: Full circle.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.840
JAKE: Back to threading.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.360
MARIKO KOSAKA:
Full circle, right?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.785
JAKE: So for me, it was
Microsoft Comic Chat.

00:06:01.785 --> 00:06:02.374
SURMA: What?

00:06:02.374 --> 00:06:03.540
JAKE: No, this is the thing.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.310
I'm assuming that's
what it's called.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.230
But you went on, and
you picked a room,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.357
and you picked a character.

00:06:08.357 --> 00:06:10.440
And you would type something,
and it would sort of

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.237
be building this comic book.

00:06:12.237 --> 00:06:14.320
So your character would
be there saying something.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.810
And someone would reply.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.190
And their character would
appear as if it was a comic.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.856
SURMA: I've never
seen or heard of that.

00:06:18.856 --> 00:06:20.880
JAKE: And people
would start replying,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.120
like, you're being
really annoying.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.500
What is all that
garbage text mean?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.817
What's going on?

00:06:26.817 --> 00:06:28.400
And it took someone
else to figure out

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.530
it was, oh, they're using
Microsoft Comic Chat.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.790
And they're like, yes,
what are you using?

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.210
Well, we are using IRC.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.880
This Microsoft Comic Right
was just an IRC client.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.580
But it would put
loads of garbage text

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.810
at the start of
everything it wrote.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.900
SURMA: Like 64 encoded images
or something along those lines.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.970
JAKE: Just like
the signal to say,

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.511
here's the character
I am, and here's

00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:49.640
the expression I'm pulling.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.405
So that was my way into IRC.

00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:52.530
And that was my first chat.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.154
MARIKO KOSAKA: Now
that you mention it,

00:06:54.154 --> 00:06:57.180
didn't we have a widget on
the side of blog or site

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.234
or something that's
like mini Twitter?

00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:02.400
JAKE: I don't remember this.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.210
SURMA: I do.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.620
I do.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.664
You could have a widget.

00:07:05.664 --> 00:07:07.080
Basically it said,
check messages.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.746
MARIKO KOSAKA: Check
messages-- but kind

00:07:08.746 --> 00:07:11.630
of anonymous-ish maybe.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.830
Maybe in the cookie, like,
your user name that you said.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.390
It was certainly not like you
create an account or anything.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.510
But I would go into certain
websites that I was following

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.390
and then look at the top page
on the side corner-- tiny box.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.390
Did somebody posted in there?

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.482
JAKE: Also, today
is my birthday.

00:07:31.482 --> 00:07:32.940
MARIKO KOSAKA: Yes,
happy birthday.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.290
JAKE: Thank you very much.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.970
And you got me a present.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.380
MARIKO KOSAKA: Yes.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.020
SURMA: Why are you
giving it to her?

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.040
It's your present.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.300
JAKE: Well, I want to
explain what is this?

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.290
MARIKO KOSAKA: So you were
explaining maybe two I/Os ago

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.320
that you got sunburned so hard.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.332
JAKE: Yes.

00:07:55.332 --> 00:07:56.540
And there are videos of that.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.500
SURMA: We have it on tape.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.041
MARIKO KOSAKA: I don't know if
I'm supposed to tell you this.

00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:02.730
But you have to put
makeup on, doing makeup

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.520
to counterbalance your redness.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.630
JAKE: I went onto YouTube, and
I typed in, help, I'm sunburned.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.940
What do I do?

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.090
And there was this tiny
woman who was like, hey,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.160
sometimes you get sunburned.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.120
And here's what you do.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.244
And I was like, tell me
your secrets, little child.

00:08:19.244 --> 00:08:20.180
What is it?

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.800
I'm going to put on
the green makeup.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.730
What?

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.720
The green makeup?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.460
What planet are you from?

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.021
And then I was like,
it's working kind of.

00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:28.520
Yeah.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.190
And so I went out and
bought some green makeup.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.280
YouTube is great for this.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.363
MARIKO KOSAKA: While we
were watching the keynote,

00:08:33.363 --> 00:08:35.570
you were putting
layers of sunscreen

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.960
and telling me that story.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.500
So I bought some
shield from the sun.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.210
It's full face.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.835
SURMA: And so I didn't feel
left out, I got one as well.

00:08:46.835 --> 00:08:47.335
JAKE: Oh!

00:08:47.335 --> 00:08:48.126
MARIKO KOSAKA: Yes!

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.550
JAKE: I feel yours is a
little bit more stylish.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.960
I don't even know how
I'm supposed to wear it.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.501
SURMA: That's up
for debate, I think.

00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:59.160
JAKE: So this is like
"Handmaid's Tale" style, right?

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.290
Is this how I'm
supposed to wear it?

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.660
Oh, so I'm supposed to go down.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.850
SURMA: That's like
a welding mask.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.690
JAKE: Welding mask.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.481
It's definitely something
I'm going to use.

00:09:10.481 --> 00:09:12.350
I'm a little bit worried.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.987
SURMA: It's going to be
difficult at the airport.

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:16.070
JAKE: It protects my face.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.580
But there's these two bits.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.540
These are going to fry and kind
of peel off like bad Doritos.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.970
SURMA: I think it's just a look
you should own as, you know.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.670
JAKE: Wow, thank you very much.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.650
MARIKO KOSAKA: This is
like having team meeting

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.070
in real life, which
never happens.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.712
Because we're all in
a different office.

00:09:34.712 --> 00:09:36.170
JAKE: Would you be
more comfortable

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.980
if we did this via Hangouts?

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.940
Because I could go over
there and get a laptop.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.815
MARIKO KOSAKA: I'll just
open a laptop, yeah.

00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:43.650
SURMA: You think the
Wi-Fi will hold up?
