00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.450
SURMA: So one thing
that really excited me--

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.350
I say excited.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.490
It's both with
happiness and sadness--

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.400
is the announcement from
Adobe that by 2020, Flash

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.575
will officially be retired.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:15.450
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes, it
no longer [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.790
shipping the player.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.152
It won't be on any browsers.

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:18.860
SURMA: It's done.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.120
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
It's bye, bye Flash.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.050
SURMA: I know, right.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.437
For me, it's like
things that need

00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:26.520
to be addressed because
you relied on the plug-in.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.160
And this plug-in, even
though it did great work,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.324
was also occasionally known
for being not very safe.

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:33.240
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.448
SURMA: And you could run
things on your computer that

00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:37.636
wasn't supposed to be
running on your computer.

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:39.729
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I loved
the ActiveX stuff.

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.270
I remember that there was one
released where you could create

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.110
a media player in ActiveX--

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.960
SURMA: Yeah.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.810
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --Which
you would use to get media.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.370
You could also iterate over
the CD drives on the computer.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.660
And one of the functions
you could call was eject.

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:00.000
As soon as I found this out, I
was like, wow, that's amazing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.541
Typey type type,
send it to a friend,

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:03.260
and watch them
across the office.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.301
And they open the thing--

00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:05.650
Whoop whoop whoop.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.550
SURMA: You say
enumerated CD drives,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.162
immediately I picture a good 'ol
tower with like 16 CD drives.

00:01:11.162 --> 00:01:14.606
JAKE ARCHIBALD: They
all just slide out.

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:18.050
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.710
But thinking about the
things that flash brought us.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.450
SURMA: I think it
had a huge impact

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.310
on setting a bar, what needs
to be possible on the web.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.160
And it took us actually way
too long to get there, I think.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.310
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Absolutely.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.900
Even one of the
most basic things

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.770
was if you brought
a PNG into flash,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.550
it would work, even with
alpha channel, fine.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.480
But then if you exported it--

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.280
you'd drop in like
a 120k PNG, and you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.730
would get this like 30k
SWF out of the other end.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.720
SURMA: That was magic.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.440
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Magic.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.650
Like

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.040
SURMA: Magic.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.415
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
What it was doing

00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:03.830
is it was encoding
the PNG as a JPEG

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.210
but then taking the alpha
channel out and keeping that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.970
as a PNG and reapplying it.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.451
So it was doing sort of
lossy with an alpha channel.

00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:12.950
SURMA: Because I remember that
you could control the quality

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.500
when you exported
from flash, and you

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.285
would get the typical
JPEG blockified artifacts.

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:18.950
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah,
it was JPEG, so--

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.034
SURMA: I didn't know that.

00:02:20.034 --> 00:02:21.616
Actually I didn't
know that until now,

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:22.908
but now it explains everything.

00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:24.657
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But
if you think about it,

00:02:24.657 --> 00:02:26.829
we are still struggling
with that on the web today.

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:27.620
SURMA: Pretty much.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.950
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We've got WebP.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.450
SURMA: Yeah.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.324
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But not
all browsers have it.

00:02:31.324 --> 00:02:32.480
SURMA: Sadly not.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.040
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think there's
a few alternate formats that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.750
have that sort of lossy
of an alpha channel.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.041
But it's incredible to think
of the very first versions

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:41.384
of Flash had that, and
we are still stuck.

00:02:41.384 --> 00:02:43.550
Thinking about other things--
oh, with video, right,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.049
on the web.

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:44.994
SURMA: Yeah.

00:02:44.994 --> 00:02:46.910
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It took
Opera many years later

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.570
to actually go, right,
we actually need this.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.870
SURMA: And it was the only
platform that did anything

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.480
with DRM in the day, which
allowed big companies to bring

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.180
their content to the web
in, at least, one shape.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.280
JAKE ARCHIBALD: The thing
is with dynamic video,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.990
we only kind of
fairly recently have--

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.490
SURMA: True.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.271
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --with
extended media extended source.

00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:06.770
SURMA: Encrypted
media [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.728
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, it's
not the encrypted one.

00:03:08.728 --> 00:03:10.480
It's the media
source extensions.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.070
SURMA: Yes.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.810
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah,
and that's where you--

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.890
SURMA: See, Paul would know that
because he wrote the media app.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.160
JAKE ARCHIBALD: He did.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.400
Oh, we should get that guy back.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.840
No, we should not.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.700
SURMA: No we shouldn't.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.283
You know what?

00:03:17.283 --> 00:03:18.600
No.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.766
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But the
same is like with web audio.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.960
That came much later
than Flash gave us it.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.420
SURMA: Even now, we are at a
point where web animations are

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.070
still not widely supported
or cover all the use cases.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.256
And that was the basic
feature of Flash.

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:32.630
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Well, to be fair,

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.350
I still think in Flash for
doing actual animations,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.300
people were very
reliant on GreenSock.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.000
Any idea you could
do your animations,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.290
but if you were animating
by code, time to get

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.335
GreenSock out.

00:03:47.335 --> 00:03:48.210
SURMA: I guess, yeah.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.380
JAKE ARCHIBALD: There wasn't
a web animation type of thing.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.874
SURMA: But it would be
great if part of the--

00:03:53.874 --> 00:03:55.790
GreenSock is still alive,
and it's super good.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.456
It would just be great
if you could just

00:03:57.456 --> 00:04:00.170
remove a chunk of the code
and have it on the platform

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.670
as it is.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.930
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh
yeah, absolutely.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.450
SURMA: Pretty much specified
as a web animation.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.680
It's just that browsers don't
have it fully implemented.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.900
And so they have to
reinvent the wheel

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.170
and make sure no restorations
happen and all these things.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.500
And I'm hoping that this
deprecation will actually--

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.180
all these things that
we talked about--

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.040
push them forward quickly than
they've been moving so far.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.060
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, I
remember when I9 came out,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.270
and SVG became a thing that
we now had to cross browsers.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.840
And then the war started late.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.632
Developers were like
SVG, it's the answer

00:04:32.632 --> 00:04:33.590
to all of our problems.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.780
And another camp
were like, no, boo!

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.280
SVG's bad.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.740
Canvas is the way forward.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.996
And I remember like me,
as a Flash developer

00:04:40.996 --> 00:04:42.370
and seeing other
Flash developers

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.700
saying the same thing, we're
like, well, the answer is both.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.800
And coming from a
flash background,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.730
well, you use the vector stuff
for vector and DOM-based things

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.439
for when you need
the interaction.

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.480
But if you just want to
draw something and then--

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.060
or even you might want to
draw something in vector

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.380
and turn it into a bitmap.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.930
You might want to take a bitmap
and make it the background

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.710
to a vector shape.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.884
And Flash really was
doing this 10 years ago.

00:05:05.884 --> 00:05:07.050
SURMA: That's the the thing.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.150
There's a tendency in the
entire community to take a tool

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.570
and make it the
tool for everything,

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.700
even though you want
to use different tools

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.930
for different purposes.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.086
And I think we're
getting better at this.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:22.460
But there's still tend to like
I want to learn one thing,

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.260
and it should cover everything.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.850
So I only have to
learn this one thing

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.439
and not bother about the
ever evolving ecosystem.

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.980
And I don't think the web is a
good place for that mentality,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.260
honestly.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, yeah,
and I think one of the things

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.720
that we need from flash that
we don't have right now is

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.150
a good IDE for doing
those kind of animations.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.970
So I know Adobe are working
on it or were working on it.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.600
I can't remember which projects
they still have on the go.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.640
But it feels like we're
losing a big group of people

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.140
who don't want to
write code but are

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.580
able to make amazing animations.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.446
So that is sort of
a loss in platform,

00:05:57.446 --> 00:05:58.820
or they've had to
go to something

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.160
like After Effects or something.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.280
And now a developer
will have to recreate

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.750
all of that in the web.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.210
So I hope we get there
with something like that.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.340
SURMA: I feel like this
deprecation is, especially

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.150
for big companies, forcing
them to invest, really,

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.492
into replacing the
Flash tool that they had

00:06:16.492 --> 00:06:18.200
with something that
is native to the web.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.890
And then hopefully, the
entire ecosystem will benefit.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.515
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.348
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Whenever
I'm writing a talk,

00:06:24.348 --> 00:06:25.550
I get the same problem.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.880
I run out of things to say,
and then I'm sitting there,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.055
going, well, that's that then.

00:06:30.055 --> 00:06:30.860
SURMA: Bye then.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.242
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Bye.
