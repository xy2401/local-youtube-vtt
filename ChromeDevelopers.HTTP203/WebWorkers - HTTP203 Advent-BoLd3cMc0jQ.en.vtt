00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.700
SPEAKER 1: So usually, we
work in intervals of years.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.370
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.560
SPEAKER 1: And our current
interval is about to end.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.100
And we called it 2017.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.660
And so I was thinking,
my next until interval,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.120
what is it going to be about?

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.720
SPEAKER 2: It's
going to be 2018.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.390
SPEAKER 1: It is going to
be 20-- yes, like a plus 1.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.632
And so I thought I
would tell you my topic.

00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:26.840
And you can ask me questions.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.210
I will have to make, explain
it to you within two minutes.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.409
SPEAKER 2: Within
two minutes, OK, go.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.652
SPEAKER 1: Workers.

00:00:33.652 --> 00:00:34.860
SPEAKER 2: I'm aware of them.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.090
SPEAKER 1: They're existing.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.756
They have been existing
for a long time.

00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:40.960
But I think we need
to start using them.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.547
SPEAKER 2: Service workers,
I've been using them.

00:00:44.547 --> 00:00:46.130
SPEAKER 1: Service
worker is not-- oh,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.350
so there's workers
as a group, I guess.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.140
But I was talking
about the web workers,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.810
the way of the web to giving
you actual parallelism,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.680
to multi-threading.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.700
SPEAKER 2: A dedicated worker.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.500
SPEAKER 1: A dedicated
worker for your site.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.083
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:00:58.083 --> 00:01:00.290
SPEAKER 1: And I
think we should be

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.010
looking at the native
platforms like iOS and Android.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.980
And what they've been
doing for quite a long time

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.160
is doing only UI work
on the main thread

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.230
and putting everything
else in a different thread.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.735
SPEAKER 2: OK, right.

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:16.352
I mean, are we not
doing that already?

00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:17.810
Some people are
doing that already.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.268
I've done that, what I'm saying
is, I've done that already.

00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:22.466
I have done that already.

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.090
SPEAKER 1: There have
been experiments.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.780
But I think it's
everything but mainstream.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.530
And I think it needs
to become mainstream.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.580
Because for the
past couple years,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.050
the problem has
always been jank,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.690
people doing too much JavaScript
on the main thread and doing

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.640
animations wrong and whatnot.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.097
And if we could just move the
expense of JavaScript code

00:01:40.097 --> 00:01:42.680
to a different thread and have
some really good parents on how

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.970
to still interact with
the UI part of your app,

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.970
you would be free to just
write some blocking code,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.060
just do some expensive
JSON object serialization.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.060
And it wouldn't really affect
the performance of your app.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.685
SPEAKER 2: So a big
part of the problem

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.212
is that communication between
the main page and the worker.

00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:02.670
Because that's so
clumsy right now.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.710
SPEAKER 1: It's post message.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.210
If you spend it with worker,
you get post message, which you

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.780
can send JSON objects at best.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.360
SPEAKER 2: We have shared
array buffer as well,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.443
which is a way you can
re-invent all of the buffer

00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:13.347
over on problems,
but on the web.

00:02:13.347 --> 00:02:14.430
SPEAKER 1: Which is great.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.020
I've been working on
things to make it easier,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.520
which, one of the
things is Comlink.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.862
But I think there's lots
of explorations to do.

00:02:19.862 --> 00:02:22.070
And it's definitely worth
doing because it would just

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.170
make the web feel
good by default.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.799
And I think that
would be really nice.

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.340
SPEAKER 2: Less jank
is a good thing.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.240
SPEAKER 1: That is a good thing.
