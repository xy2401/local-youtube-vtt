00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.810
JAKE: We need a name
for the segment.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.740
What is it?

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.274
SURMA: Is it the Two-minute
Speech Run Over the Web?

00:00:06.274 --> 00:00:07.440
JAKE: Two-minute Speech Run.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.189
That's pretty good,
because I was thinking

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:11.950
of, like, HTTP 203 in Two.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.829
SURMA: [LAUGHS]

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.329
JAKE: But it's just too many
numbers then, really, isn't it?

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.912
SURMA: I mean, we
could drive it home.

00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:20.842
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.022
JAKE: So two minutes.

00:00:25.022 --> 00:00:26.480
You're going to
talk about a thing.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.670
And what are you
going to talk about?

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.070
SURMA: I'm going to talk
about my recent explorations

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.750
with Webpack &amp; Workers.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.980
JAKE: You have two minutes.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.300
Go.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.042
SURMA: Workers.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:38.250
JAKE: Yes, I'm aware of them.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.010
Still, I think this is a
copy of exactly what we

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.660
said in the previous episode.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.000
SURMA: But now imagine
you want to have

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.871
module loading in Workers.

00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:48.120
JAKE: Well, you can have that.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.250
That's the import function.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.470
SURMA: But it's not available
in Workers anywhere yet.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.970
JAKE: Yet.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.000
SURMA: So for now, you can't.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.210
JAKE: OK.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.085
SURMA: But-- so OK,
cool, let's use something

00:00:57.085 --> 00:00:59.370
like Rollup or Webpack,
where you basically

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.880
transform the syntax into
just inlining the things

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.800
or loading with some
other mechanism.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.080
Workers have input script.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.210
The main thread has script tags.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.930
So we can emulate the behavior.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.430
JAKE: Yes.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.500
SURMA: So I look into Webpack.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.900
And I was trying to
build a little app that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.330
has logic in the Worker
and UI in the main thread.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.200
And had some module that was
shared between the main thread

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.950
and the Worker.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.450
JAKE: Ah.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.190
SURMA: Right?

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.740
JAKE: And this is something
you can deal with,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.865
because you can have, like
you say, your main page,

00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:30.390
just including it as a
script tag or dynamic import.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.580
And your Worker can use
that horrible import script

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.240
synchronous function.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.650
But it works.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.860
SURMA: Exactly.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.380
So yeah.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.330
And my thought was, Webpack
should figure this out, right?

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.307
Like, it should see,
oh, this is shared code,

00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:39.765
let's put this in
a separate file--

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:41.430
JAKE: Using its
commons chunking stuff.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.060
SURMA: So exactly.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.565
JAKE: And it realizes,
oh, here's the common bit.

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:44.450
I'll put that into
a separate file.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.750
Right, problem solved.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.740
SURMA: You would think.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.340
Not quite.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.730
JAKE: Oh, no.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.313
SURMA: So there's a
slight difference.

00:01:49.313 --> 00:01:51.660
So because in Webpack
you have entry points.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.840
And these entry points
are assumed that you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.000
take one of them at a time.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.120
But with a Worker, you
actually take an entry point

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.124
and the Worker entry
point at the same time.

00:02:02.124 --> 00:02:03.540
So there's a
different assumption,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.620
because between entry
points, usually Webpack

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.495
doesn't put common
modules in a shared thing.

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:11.494
JAKE: So this is when
you're using Webpack to do

00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:12.850
the work and magic for you.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.950
SURMA: Yeah.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.800
JAKE: What if you just
do it separately--

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.110
you've got two entry points?

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.660
One of them actually works.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.780
SURMA: Well, it doesn't know
that they're shared modules.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.910
JAKE: Oh.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.743
SURMA: Or at least I
haven't figured it out.

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:21.510
So now I have put
in an issue, and I'm

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.220
going to discuss with
the Webpack people

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.300
how we can support Workers,
because I feel like I want

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.710
to make 2018 about Workers.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.946
So we need support
and tooling for that.

00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:34.834
JAKE: That was very
good timing, because--

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:36.350
[BEEPING]

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.850
SURMA: Ah.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.450
JAKE: Nicely done.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.370
SURMA: It's music to my ears.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.120
JAKE: Nicely done.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.400
It's not as good as the
one we used at Christmas.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.030
If I set that off again, do
you want to just beatbox?

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.196
And then we could dub that--

00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:51.760
so I'll give you
10, maybe 5 seconds.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.337
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:02:55.337 --> 00:02:56.798
[BEEPING]

00:02:56.798 --> 00:02:59.233
SURMA: [BEATBOXES]

00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:01.520
JAKE: [WHISTLES] That's
just-- that was bad.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.370
[LAUGHTER]
