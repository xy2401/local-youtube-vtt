[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:08.860
JAKE: We are in the
month of Christmas.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.550
But that is also the
last month of 2017.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.936
So we're thinking towards
2018 and the things that

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:15.810
are going to be landing
in browsers or things

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.410
we'll be thinking
about in that year.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.990
So I want you to
spend the next two

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.970
minutes introducing a subject.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.230
You can quiz me about it.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.646
And we'll see if we can come
up with something that we can

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:25.930
actually publish on YouTube.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.250
All right.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.750
Here we go.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.510
Two minutes.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.760
I want to talk about
weightless CSS.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.345
SURMA: Weightless?

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:33.250
JAKE: That is one
of the words I said.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.690
The other one is CSS.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.500
SURMA: So CSS without weight.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.320
JAKE: Yes.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.334
That is a good reversal
of what I said.

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:40.250
SURMA: What is weight?

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.100
JAKE: OK.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.450
So when you write A CSS
selector, it has specificity.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.420
SURMA: That is correct.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.195
JAKE: Yes.

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:49.516
Which I could call
weight if I didn't

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.640
want to risk trying to
pronounce specificity again.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.310
SURMA: Oh.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.210
So you mean
specificity-less CSS?

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.140
JAKE: Specificity-less
CSS is exactly--

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.600
can you see now why I
went for weightless CSS?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.854
So this is a proposal that
was agreed on in TPAC in 2017.

00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:09.520
And [INAUDIBLE] was
telling me about it.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.180
And the idea was that-- they
haven't settled on a name yet,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.350
but it would be
something like is,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.850
in the same way
that you would use--

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.810
SURMA: Oh, like colon
is, and then a function.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.800
JAKE: Yes.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.890
Exactly that.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.140
And inside you could put
like a simple selector,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.195
like dot [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:31.750
SURMA: So that would make
a selector make match

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.490
without increasing
its specificity.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.780
JAKE: Exactly that.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.446
So you'd be able to
use all of the stuff

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:39.670
that you can use outside
is, or whatever it's called,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.230
but it would have
like zero specificity.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.925
SURMA: Why?

00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:46.030
JAKE: Because this is the
CSS working group's attempt

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.630
to meet people halfway that
don't enjoy the cascade so

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.245
much.

00:01:50.245 --> 00:01:51.370
SURMA: Oh, I see.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.470
SPEAKER 1: So one of the
things that complaints--

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.870
or one of the reasons
they've seen people go to CSS

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.589
and JavaScript is
that this whole--

00:01:58.589 --> 00:02:00.505
SURMA: Just attach it
to the element directly.

00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:01.670
JAKE: Exactly.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.330
Because then the
model's a lot simpler.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.496
So it's, can they bring
that to regular style sheets

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:08.845
as an option where just things
will be done sequentially?

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:12.322
SURMA: Can I use child
selectors in the is thing?

00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:13.280
JAKE: I don't think so.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.340
SURMA: Because that was one
the long standing things

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.140
that people wanted to,
that if you contain

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.249
a thing of that type, then
style me the other way around,

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:21.790
or something.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.290
JAKE: No.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.364
It would just be simple
selectors but no specificity.

00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:32.500
SURMA: We're out of time.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.900
It's a template
proposal from Apple.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.430
JAKE: Oh, Apple
template proposal.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.888
SURMA: The Apple
template proposal.

00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:41.980
JAKE: So like what
have they proposed?
