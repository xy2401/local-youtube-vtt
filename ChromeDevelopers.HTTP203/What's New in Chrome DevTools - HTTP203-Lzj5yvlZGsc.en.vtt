have that on camera,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.680
there's no product placement.

Starting with [? five ?] review.

PAUL IRISH: OK.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.645
JASON MILLER: Who is Paul?

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:34.890
PAUL IRISH: I'm Paul Irish.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.030
I work on performance
stuff DevTools Lighthouse.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.420
And I do it because
I love the web.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.656
I like it to be fast.

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:46.730
JAKE: And now you.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.390
JASON MILLER: I'm Jason Miller,
and I work on speed and loading

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.820
stuff.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.230
And I do it because I
had a slow phone once

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.341
and it was a pretty
poor experience.

00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:58.590
SURMA: Ah, hashtag #relatable.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.490
JASON MILLER: Yeah,
very relatable.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.750
I still live in North America,
so I have it pretty good.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.566
But a slow phone will let
you know what's going on.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.240
JAKE: So you did
your talk today.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.087
SURMA: You had the glorious
8:30 spot in the morning.

00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:13.170
JAKE: 8:30 in the morning.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.140
You were speaking to an
audience of about one or two?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.807
PAUL IRISH: Yes.

00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:18.098
JASON MILLER: Captive audience.

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:18.810
JAKE: Excellent.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.810
That was the two of you?

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.530
SURMA: But those
people really cared.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.540
That's the upside.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.040
JASON MILLER: That's why they
put the mirror up at the back.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.124
JAKE: We missed your talk
because we were filming.

00:01:27.124 --> 00:01:27.915
We weren't filming.

00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:29.100

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

JASON MILLER: You were
doing film while you slept.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.430
JAKE: So we don't have
to watch the video,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.540
can you just give us the
30 second version of it?

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.150
PAUL IRISH: You can change any
website you want with DevTools

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.410
and then reload, and those
changes are still there.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.530
SURMA: I love that feature.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.825
I used it this morning.

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:52.203
JAKE: So what could I change?

00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:54.036
PAUL IRISH: Change the
CSS, change the HTML,

00:01:54.036 --> 00:01:54.720
change the JavaScript.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.440
JASON MILLER: Anything that
comes down over the network.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.895
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

JAKE: Anything that
comes down over the work?

JASON MILLER: Yeah,
literally anything.

change in DevTools plus more.

JAKE: What if it's
changed on disk as well?

00:02:04.747 --> 00:02:07.080
What if the thing that served
on the network has changed

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.079
and you've made changes?

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.539

if service work is

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.740
involved or anything like that.

You know what you're
doing supposedly.

JAKE: Well, I don't know.

00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:23.250
It could have done some
clever diffing and then

own the entire file.

delete that overwriting file.

disk, which is also cool--

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.370

made, you can actually--

feature we didn't

show-- if you have an image,
you can drag an image on top

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.030

tab, and it will overwrite it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.285

00:02:49.576 --> 00:02:52.380
How does this act if my
banner image is going to fail

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.110

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.140
Do you just drag
this empty image?

PAUL IRISH: That's a lot.

00:02:55.181 --> 00:02:57.990
It's nice, because
a lot of things

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.110
doing the actual change
on the back end for real

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.760
takes a bit of work.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.550
Yeah, you can mock out an air--

mock out anything,
any potential case.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.530
And the other nice thing is
we also showed in performance

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.350
scenarios, say, for instance you
wanted to see what would happen

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.380
if I add link rel pre-load
for whatever assets,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.962
you can just try that
out just in the HTML,

00:03:18.962 --> 00:03:20.670
and not change all
the things that need--

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.080

something that I have

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.430
waited for a long time
in a way, because we

was a lot more complicated.

me with this problem?

compared to the server copy.

thing it doesn't have is ML.

You can now step
into async functions.

So you step into a set time out.

And you'll get dropped
off inside of the callback

you pass to the set time out.

Step across thread
boundaries in Pulse Message.

You can step into the
Worker Constructor.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.860
It will drop you off in
the first line of Worker.

Worker Constructor?

thenable, just step into that.

JAKE: Even if it's not
an official V8 promise,

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.946
if it's thenable, we can--

00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:49.320
SURMA: Something
I haven't tried,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.660
but I was meaning to ask, I can
have multiple message listeners

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.710
on the worker side?

PAUL IRISH: Yes, but untested.

too much stepping

don't deserve a good debugging

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.160
Adding multiple listeners?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.539
SURMA: Multiple message
listeners in a worker.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:07.080
That's just--

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.290
JAKE: It's a legitimate thing.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.825
SURMA: Why?

00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:10.260
JAKE: OK.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.660
You've written a library that
does message handling stuff.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.540
You've been adding
your listeners.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.200
But then I might have my own
stuff I want to listen to.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.070
And a lower thing.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.695
SURMA: And then you
have two listeners.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.100
You have to distinguish if
this message-- nah, nah.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.792
JAKE: Is your library
not support that?

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:27.000
Just talk amongst yourselves.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.712
I'm just going to be filing
an issue on Com Link.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.240
So what's next with it?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.410
Is there anything else before
I start asking what's next?

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.730
JASON MILLER: We can go deeper.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.880
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.960
We showed a new feature
called Eager Evaluation.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.260
SURMA: Oh, I've seen this.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.510
I was wondering what it means.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.218
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:05:47.218 --> 00:05:48.270
So you're in the console.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.020
And you type out
something in the console.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.625
But before you hit Enter,
you get the result.

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:56.050
JAKE: That sounds obnoxious.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.500
JASON MILLER: I call
it belligerent console.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.360
SURMA: That's like
prefetching in Chrome.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.920
You just type [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.836
It's already fetching.

00:06:01.836 --> 00:06:02.878
And you're like, stop it!

00:06:02.878 --> 00:06:04.544
PAUL IRISH: So it's
a bit like proactive

00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:06.950
of the console where you're
like, I know you're not done,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.960
but here you go.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.896
SURMA: Doesn't it do it with
functions or mostly properties?

00:06:11.896 --> 00:06:13.630
PAUL IRISH: Great question.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.709
Everything that it can.

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:16.125
So definitely
including functions.

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:17.230
SURMA: What about side effects?

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.063
PAUL IRISH: Exactly.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.530
The V8 has worked to
introduce a new mode where

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.410
we can guarantee there are no
side effects for whatever this

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.910
is.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.740
So if we see that a side
effect is about to be caused,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.390
we just bail
evaluation [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.186
SURMA: Isn't that
Meltdown and Spectre?

00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:34.655
JAKE: What?

00:06:34.655 --> 00:06:36.625
SURMA: They assume
they're going down a path,

00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:37.750
and they have to roll back.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.400
JAKE: Oh, Meltdown and Spectre.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.460
I thought you said that
melts the inspector.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.078
I was just imagining all the
pixels going down the screen.

00:06:46.078 --> 00:06:48.454
SURMA: And now we're back
to our surreal approach

00:06:48.454 --> 00:06:49.120
to this episode.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.500
JAKE: We've got this bug again.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.720
Salvador Dali mode.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.050
The clock's melting again.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.364
We shouldn't have had
Eager Evaluation there.

00:07:00.364 --> 00:07:01.921
Shipped it too early.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:02.920
SURMA: That sounds good.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.380
I'm guessing it
[INAUDIBLE] if you

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.011
like Eager Evaluate fetches.

00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:09.010
JASON MILLER: So you can't
Eager Evaluate fetch,

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.180
because it's a side effect.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.680
But--

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.500
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.904
PAUL IRISH: It has side effects.

00:07:13.904 --> 00:07:15.570
SURMA: So it's like
don't do that, then.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.660
JASON MILLER: So no, but
you can do something.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.090
So in our demo, we showed you
could JSON parse a string.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.260
And it will run the JSON
parse because there's

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.580
no side effect there.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.240
And then you can look at the
drop down menu for suggestions,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.140
and it will include properties
from the JSON you parsed.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.330
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.830
JASON MILLER: It
has never been run.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.909
JAKE: What if I change
the array constructor,

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:32.950
and then pass some JSON--

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.010
SURMA: Then you
are a bad person.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.900
JASON MILLER: No, it depends.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.010
If you change the
array constructor

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.630
to an implementation that
doesn't have side effects,

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.770
[CLICK] you're good.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.854
JAKE: It will detect that?

00:07:39.854 --> 00:07:40.686
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:40.686 --> 00:07:42.340
JASON MILLER: It goes
all the way down.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.631
And I know because I tried
to break this for two hours.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:47.880
JAKE: So how is a side
effect defined here?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.510
I guess it's if
the method is just

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.132
effecting anything outside
of its closure, I guess?

00:07:53.132 --> 00:07:56.515
PAUL IRISH: Anything
outside of this.

00:07:56.515 --> 00:07:58.190
You can have functions.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.460
There's a lot that can
happen inside of this.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.450
But for instance, we demoed
with regular expressions

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.855
the exec method.

00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:08.980
SURMA: Which is side effecty,
technically speaking.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.300
JASON MILLER: [INAUDIBLE]
on the regular expressions.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.925
SURMA: Exactly.

00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:12.610
PAUL IRISH: Yes,
on the expression.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.360
But then regular
expressions match and test,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.960
those effect the global
RegEx constructor.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.794
Turns out, changes--

00:08:20.794 --> 00:08:22.043
JASON MILLER: Well known fact.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.160
I learned this last night.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.690
RegEx constructor
dot dollar sign

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.140
underscore is the previous
match from string dot match.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.380
There's also dollar sign 1
through 9 and last match.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.549
SURMA: That is disgusting.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.319
JASON MILLER: Never use these.

00:08:35.319 --> 00:08:38.950
PAUL IRISH: So because those
exist, they are side effects.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.659
And so match and test
can't be used under this--

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.659
JASON MILLER: Stay tuned
for a upcoming campaign

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:44.650
to discontinue those properties.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.150
SURMA: Is there a
little check box

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.680
where I can enable and disable.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.513
I'm just wondering if
I have a for loop that

00:08:49.513 --> 00:08:51.640
does 10 million iterations,
and it takes 20 seconds

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.352
to evaluate, I might want
to disable it on every key.

00:08:54.352 --> 00:08:55.060
PAUL IRISH: Sure.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.790
Right now it is opt in.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.640
So that we handle
some of these cases.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.000
We do handle the case of
you have an infinite loop

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.400
like we know.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.460
And so we won't
hang your browser.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.180
SURMA: It's like
rubbing it in face of--

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.971
PAUL IRISH: There may
be some other things.

00:09:10.971 --> 00:09:13.220
So as we refine those,
it will be opt in.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.835
But I expect at
some point, I hope,

00:09:14.835 --> 00:09:16.960
that we will be able to
just turn it off everybody.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.430
JASON MILLER: I played
with this for hours,

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.070
and I never managed to break it.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.252
And that was really trying.

00:09:21.252 --> 00:09:22.210
SURMA: How do I opt in?

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.000
PAUL IRISH: So grab Chrome
Canary, open up Console.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.436
There's a little settings cog to
add the console settings where

00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:29.560
you can turn on timestamps.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.393
It's right in there.

00:09:30.393 --> 00:09:32.610
And it says Eager Evaluation.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.380
JAKE: Going to have
to play with that.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.000
Brilliant.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.910
So what's next then?

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.415
What's DevTools going to
do now next 12 months?

00:09:40.415 --> 00:09:43.840
PAUL IRISH: Right as
we finish the talk,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.390
we did get a
screenshot sent over

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.390
from some of the engineers
in the DevTools team

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.860
showing us something
that they just

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:56.661
landed today, and neglected
to tell us about yesterday.

00:09:56.661 --> 00:09:57.160
And--

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.576
JASON MILLER: For
the first time--

00:09:58.576 --> 00:09:59.826
SURMA: Turns out his IO.

00:09:59.826 --> 00:10:01.159
JAKE: Do you want to explain it?

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:03.860
JASON MILLER: So when we were
looking at the Eager Eval,

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.030
I was thinking it would
avoid a lot of me pulling up

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.020
MDN if you could show the
parameters that Dom methods

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.370
and stuff like that accepts.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.472
They're there in Chrome.

00:10:13.472 --> 00:10:14.305
We have the web IDL.

00:10:14.305 --> 00:10:14.952
JAKE: Right.

00:10:14.952 --> 00:10:16.660
And even if we didn't,
there's TypeScript

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.600
has documented
this stuff as well.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.090
JASON MILLER: This works.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.010
JAKE: Oh!

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.520
Brilliant.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:23.750
OK.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.250
So just the names
of the parameters.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.430
What about things that
take different [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.270
overloaded?

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:29.770
Who knows?

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.646
SURMA: It landed today!

00:10:31.646 --> 00:10:32.900
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.670
JASON MILLER: Let
me go ask the guy!

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.260
SURMA: Cut these
people some slack.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.570
JAKE: Sorry.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.450
I'm only asking questions
because I'm excited.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.490
That's a exercise
for the listener.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.090
Brilliant.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.480
SURMA: Some people look
into more visual debugging

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.580
for layouting stuff.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.720
Is that's something
we're looking into?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.970
PAUL IRISH: I think there's
some good potential there.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.340
Between working with the
Flexbox, working with Grid,

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.230
I know that I always
have to let go.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.090
Look up degradation
or find a tool

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.975
where I can just
prototype things out.

00:11:00.975 --> 00:11:02.850
JASON MILLER: We have
some CSS variable stuff

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:03.600
to date for that.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.150
You can see colored
previews for your variables,

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.325
that kind of stuff.

00:11:06.325 --> 00:11:08.700
What kind of nose is able to
pierce through find elements

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.197
specific variable values.

00:11:11.197 --> 00:11:12.530
PAUL IRISH: That stuff is there.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.210
I think some of
the layouty things

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.820
are a little bit more
tricky to find out a design

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.530
that both handles
the case of I'm

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.059
creating something brand new,
and I have an existing layout.

00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:22.850
I want to tweak it.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:23.808
I want to work with it.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.640
SURMA: I'm not saying it's easy.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.140
JAKE: Because we've
got this problem

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.340
that with Flexbox
and Grid as well,

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.160
that the default
layout in a lot of them

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.850
is stretch, which leads to
this kind of multi-pass layout

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:34.591
thing.

00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:37.090
You layout the first box, go
to the second box, it's bigger.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.631
So it needs to go back to the
first box, change size of that,

00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:40.990
and so on and so on.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.181
And there's no way of
knowing that's happening.

00:11:44.181 --> 00:11:46.430
JASON MILLER: We've been
talking about adding warnings

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.820
for some of these things.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.960
Your layout may be slow.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.240
A little information about it.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:50.810
Just letting you know.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:51.510
JAKE: OK.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.160
That's a good first step.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.790
JASON MILLER: Possibly
expensive layout [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.240
SURMA: Leave room for
improvement as well.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.080
JAKE: That's probably good.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.610
JASON MILLER: Or we could have
announcements at each event.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:58.490
JAKE: I was just
wondering if you'd

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.150
been sent a screen shot of
anything that solves that

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.630
as well.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.330
JASON MILLER: No
screen shots so far.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.570
I could doctor one for you.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.702
JAKE: Go and check your
email now, just in case.

00:12:04.702 --> 00:12:06.910
Seems like this stuff
is landing really fast.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.140
JASON MILLER: Well, every
time we think of a feature,

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.940
one of the guys on
the DevTools team

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.257
sends us a screenshot
saying I already did this.

00:12:14.257 --> 00:12:15.340
SURMA: Well, I have ideas.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.030
Maybe I should do that as well.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.030
Well, have ideas and then
magically they appear.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.680
That seems like a
fun job to have.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.013
JAKE: That doesn't happen to me.

00:12:22.013 --> 00:12:23.560
My books get rejected
for DevTools.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.230
I've [INAUDIBLE] I wanted
disable all non website fonts.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.952
Can we make that happen?

00:12:29.952 --> 00:12:32.160
Because I forget that I have
all the fonts installed.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.010
And what was the other one?

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:37.510
Li-fi!

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.730
I want li-fi in network mode.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.105
JASON MILLER: That
would be nice.

00:12:40.105 --> 00:12:41.480
SURMA: What is
missing for li-fi?

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.813
JAKE: They didn't like the name.

00:12:42.813 --> 00:12:44.180
SURMA: Oh, this is name.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.580
Put your banding in there.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.060
We'll just have
your face in there.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.779
PAUL IRISH: Make li-fi
into a real, real thing.

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:52.820
Get it in the dictionary.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.190
JAKE: Well, I was hoping to get
in the dictionary through this.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.650
This is the [INAUDIBLE] way--

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.357
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:58.357 --> 00:13:00.690
SURMA: Do you have li-fi as
your own preset in DevTools?

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:01.580
JAKE: Yes, I do.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:01.970
SURMA: Of course you do.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:02.470
JAKE: Yeah.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.610
SURMA: Shared, as
like a little gist.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.630
JAKE: OK.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.074
OK.
