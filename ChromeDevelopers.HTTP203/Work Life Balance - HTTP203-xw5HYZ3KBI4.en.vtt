00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.424
SURMA: Well, I went on vacation.

00:00:01.424 --> 00:00:02.673
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, well done.

00:00:02.673 --> 00:00:05.100
SURMA: And tried to do the
whole work-life balance thing.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.891
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:00:05.891 --> 00:00:07.920
SURMA: And just,
you know, I put my--

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.645
so I took my iPad with
me and my work phone.

00:00:10.645 --> 00:00:13.020
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's a good
start to work-life balance.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.780
I went on holiday
with my work phone.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.760
SURMA: I only have one phone,
and it's my work phone.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.551
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.700
SURMA: So to enforce the
work-life balance thing,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.070
the phone lived in the safe.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.330
JAKE ARCHIBALD: In the safe.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.739
And that's, of course,
a Faraday cage.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:27.780
SURMA: No, but it keeps--

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.182
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You should
put it in the microwave, mate.

00:00:30.182 --> 00:00:31.140
SURMA: It keeps me out.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.630
That's the point.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.338
I could have put it
in the fridge, maybe.

00:00:33.338 --> 00:00:35.348
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.970
I feel I've not been very
good at the work-life balance

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.830
in my past vacations.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.740
I had my phone.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.570
It has all my private accounts
but also my work accounts

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.610
on it, so work chat is on there.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490
Work email is on there as well.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.330
And so you have this whole--

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.880
you're browsing things, might
as well check into work email.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.720
And then you read something.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.303
You think, oh, I should react,
even though you're on vacation.

00:01:01.303 --> 00:01:02.320
It just-- it keeps you--

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.153
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:01:03.153 --> 00:01:05.870
SURMA: --engaged in a way
that it really shouldn't.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.350
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I find that even
if I'm not deliberately going

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.056
to my phone to check
work stuff, I'll--

00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:12.180
SURMA: You end up doing it.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.940
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, I'll be
out and about, and I'll go,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.564
oh, I don't know how
to get to a place.

00:01:15.564 --> 00:01:17.385
So I'll use Maps.

00:01:17.385 --> 00:01:18.510
And so I pull out my phone.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.410
And while I'm there
I see a tweet.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.140
And I see the
start of it saying,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.570
"This article is stupid, and."

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.278
And I'm like-- and
even if I try to not--

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:28.430
SURMA: Must read.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.877
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes, because
if I don't respond then, then

00:01:30.877 --> 00:01:32.710
in my mind it's just
going to be like, well,

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.560
what article are
they talking about?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.170
What have I got wrong?

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.590
Is it genuinely wrong,
or are they wrong?

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.930
And, you know, that whole XKCD--

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.160
SURMA: That's the thing.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --someone
is wrong on the internet.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.252
And it might be me.

00:01:39.252 --> 00:01:39.960
It might be them.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.920
But I need to find out who.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.190
SURMA: Someone is
wrong on the internet.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.540
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.956
SURMA: I feel like
for some reason

00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:47.030
you feel you have
this obligation

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.645
to respond to people quickly.

00:01:48.645 --> 00:01:49.520
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.603
SURMA: If it's a person
you don't know on Twitter,

00:01:51.603 --> 00:01:55.140
they are, like, insulting
you for the stupid article

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.510
you wrote, there is
no obligation for you

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.127
to respond within 10 minutes
of him authoring that tweet.

00:02:00.127 --> 00:02:00.960
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.871
SURMA: You can do it
two or three days later.

00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:05.370
So I think this topic is just
interesting, because every now

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.620
and then I see
tweets about people

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.025
who are having the time
to work on software,

00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:13.900
web development, whatever,
in your spare time

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.422
is a matter of privilege.

00:02:15.422 --> 00:02:17.880
And then I see other people
tweeting, oh, it's the weekend.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.780
What should I do?

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.179
Vote on this Twitter poll
if I should learn React,

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:22.095
or if I should learn--

00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:22.970
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.380
SURMA: And I'm like, this
is probably not healthy.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.950
I know for myself that sometimes
if I have a massive project--

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.825
my hobby is also my job
or has become my job.

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:34.241
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right, so if
you do your hobby at weekend,

00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:35.380
you are doing your job.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.330
SURMA: In a way, yes.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.150
But also the other way around.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.010
If I'm working, I'm
kind of doing my hobby.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.130
And I feel that this
absolutely should not

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.660
be an expectation for anyone.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.240
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, no,
and I don't think it is.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.900
But it's become culturally
normal within developers.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.400
SURMA: I think in
the startup scene,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.450
I feel like you are
expected to have--

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.970
or some companies look
at-- you get a profile.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.880
If you have not a consistently
green contribution bar, meaning

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.940
you have committed something
on every day of the week,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.189
you will have less
chance of being hired

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.480
than somebody who does do that.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.688
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Whenever I
interview somewhere, which

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:12.790
has been a while, but you
know that bit where they say,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.790
do you have any
questions for me?

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.840
You know, every interview
someone asks that.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.730
The question I ask them is,
your employees, your developers,

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.720
they're working late or a
weekend because of a deadline.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.810
SURMA: Yeah.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.770
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Do you see that
as just something that happens?

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.560
Or is it a failure in planning?

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.851
Because it has to really
be one of those two things.

00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:37.350
SURMA: Yeah.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.100
JAKE ARCHIBALD: The
answer I'm not looking

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.790
for is, it's just what we do.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.540
SURMA: Yeah, that
shouldn't be the answer.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.870
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.245
SURMA: I think it can be--
that's something that happens.

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:47.910
Because it is incredibly
hard to do planning.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.580
But then there must be the
second thing that says,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.020
you will get that time back.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.670
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right,
OK, that's fair.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.045
Saying it just happens and
it's expected to deal with it,

00:03:56.045 --> 00:03:57.220
that's the wrong answer.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.677
The correct answer is, yeah, it
was a failure in the planning.

00:04:00.677 --> 00:04:02.010
It couldn't have been predicted.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.420
But here's how we deal with it.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.100
As you say, you
get the time back

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.011
is really the ideal answer.

00:04:07.011 --> 00:04:07.510
SURMA: Yeah.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.060
JAKE ARCHIBALD: The other wrong
answer, or probably the worst

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.980
answer, is that doesn't happen.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.946
Because that means that manager
is unaware of it happening.

00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:15.320
SURMA: Or lying,
and both are not

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.620
good qualities in a manager.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.620
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.269
Exactly.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.329
SURMA: So yeah, and I felt
like something I wanted,

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.150
because I was on vacation
browsing Twitter,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.130
and I saw these tweets.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.838
It's the weekend.

00:04:25.838 --> 00:04:26.830
What should I do?

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.680
And I was like, my
first reaction was, oh,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.587
I'm just playing literally
stupid games on my iPad.

00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:36.420
Maybe I should be working
on a side project.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.240
Use the time to
expand my horizon.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.156
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:42.160
SURMA: And I had to convince
myself that it is OK to--

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.205
what might be perceived
as wasting time.

00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:45.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.146
SURMA: But I have noticed
that following your gut

00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:48.520
and just allowing
you to be lazy,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.130
if that's how you feel
like, it is so refreshing.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.256
It is such an energy boost.

00:04:52.256 --> 00:04:53.796
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But
we are definitely

00:04:53.796 --> 00:04:56.050
saying this from a point
of view of a company which

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.160
does do it right.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.724
SURMA: Yeah.

00:04:57.724 --> 00:04:59.890
JAKE ARCHIBALD: A lot of
people are working weekends

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.390
because their job depends on it.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.610
I mean--

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.410
SURMA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.826
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --and working
longer hours does not scale.

00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:07.725
SURMA: No, that will bite you
if you do it for too long.

00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:09.850
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So what's
your answer, then, Surma?

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.300
Like, if someone's working--

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.790
SURMA: That's a nice way
of putting me on the spot.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.581
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Are
you saying, oh, they're

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.179
got to change job, right?

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:18.720
SURMA: I've seen this argument
before, and it makes me angry.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.240
That people are like, oh, if
you have to support IE 11,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.140
I would switch jobs.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.181
And I was like, not
everybody has the opportunity

00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:26.080
to change a job.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.940
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Right, absolutely.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.130
SURMA: I know that in our
line of work, specifically

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.940
web developers, there's
a massive demand.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.890
So you usually can say, I'm
just going to leave company A,

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.571
and I'll be pretty confident
to find another job somewhere

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:39.070
else.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.490
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.390
SURMA: Usually in
web development

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.223
that will work because
the demand is so big.

00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:44.685
But if you are not
necessarily in that spot--

00:05:44.685 --> 00:05:45.560
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.330
SURMA: --it can
get a lot harder.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.913
Or if you don't have
enough experience

00:05:47.913 --> 00:05:50.834
to get all these jobs going that
want eight years of experience

00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:53.000
with React, even though
it's only been out for five.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.950
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah,
I know a lot of people

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.616
doing development work up north,
because that's where I'm from--

00:05:56.616 --> 00:05:57.800
North of England.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.630
SURMA: Are you?

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.290
I didn't know.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.460
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.180
The accent's still
there, unfortunately.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.180
There's not as many jobs
as there are in London.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.763
So that sort of
attitude of, like, oh,

00:06:05.763 --> 00:06:07.660
just change a job if
you don't like it,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.670
yeah, it comes across as
incredibly privileged, snobby.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.560
Yeah.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.180
SURMA: I think, as always, it
requires a shift in paradigms

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.280
in the entire field of work.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.364
And that's not easy to do.

00:06:19.364 --> 00:06:21.488
But it's just something
that you as a person should

00:06:21.488 --> 00:06:23.660
be aware of-- that what
you are doing right now

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.289
is not scalable,
and that you need

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:26.830
to take time for
yourself if you have

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.650
been working the last three
weekends or something.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.490
Because, as I said,
it doesn't scale.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.870
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well,
eventually you hit 24 hours,

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.630
and then you can't
work a 25th hour.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.740
And at some point, you die.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.574
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:40.574 --> 00:06:41.490
SURMA: That went dark.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.730
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's not--

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.688
SURMA: And then the heat
death of the universe.

00:06:43.688 --> 00:06:45.830
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well,
it's not sustainable.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.602
So yeah, is that your
advice, just work less?

00:06:48.602 --> 00:06:49.930
SURMA: Yeah, just work less.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.730
No, I think it's
just like if you

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.411
need to fight for your right--

00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:54.452
JAKE ARCHIBALD: To party.

00:06:54.452 --> 00:06:55.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.465
SURMA: To not work if you
are not on work hours.

00:06:58.465 --> 00:07:01.014
If you leave the
job, it must be OK.

00:07:01.014 --> 00:07:03.430
JAKE ARCHIBALD: People who are
working more sensible hours

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.310
tend to get the same
amount of work done.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.630
SURMA: Yeah.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.640
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
that same problem.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.540
I had it last week.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.090
I was working on
a piece of code,

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.610
and I was just hitting my head
against it for like two hours.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.010
And I did the thing where I
eventually walked away and just

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.270
took half an hour to just--

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.099
I left the office.

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:23.140
I just walked around the
block a couple of times.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.512
I came back to my desk, and
I solved it in five minutes.

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:26.470
SURMA: Ah, I love that.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:27.229
I love this.

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.020
I mean, I hate it
because it's frustrating.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.035
But I've experienced
so often where

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:32.290
it's like, just take a break.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.340
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.070
But taking a break while
there's a code problem there

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.970
is near impossible.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.470
SURMA: You feel like you have
this entire thing-- construct,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.730
build up, and it will
just vanish if you leave,

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.570
and you'll have to start over.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.220
But that's usually
not what happens,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.300
because the construct is
usually what is wrong.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.399
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well,
the problem I have--

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:51.000
and I think I might have
spoken about it on the show--

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.210
can we call it a show?

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.324
Let's call it a show--

00:07:53.324 --> 00:07:54.740
spoken about it
on the show before

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.150
is that if I leave
a code problem

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.460
and then go into a
social environment--

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.500
or it could just be having
dinner with my partner

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.500
or being out with
friends, there is still

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.050
80% of my brain trying
to solve the problem.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.740
But now I don't even
have a code editor.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.130
So I'm hitting my head
against the problem even worse

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.510
than I was at my desk.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.599
So the break I took
was just on my own,

00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:18.640
didn't have to socialize.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.460
I was still sort of roughly
thinking about the problem

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.250
but also listening to a podcast.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.990
SURMA: Yeah, fresh
oxygen and just getting

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.040
distracted every now and then.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.480
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And came
back and went, oh, yeah.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.340
That's the order.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.570
Oh, it works.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.460
SURMA: Yes, it was a semicolon.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.530
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.370
So, yeah, overworked
people are bad coders.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.669
But I don't know the answer
if you're in a situation where

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.549
you can't avoid it.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.030
SURMA: No, I'm not
saying I have the answer.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.390
It's just something I
thought about on vacation.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.942
I was like, I'm trying to get
better with this because I

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:46.900
have a job where I can.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.771
But it should be a high
priority for more people.

00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:53.270
JAKE ARCHIBALD: In
the last episode,

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.869
we spoke a lot about
needing views and stuff.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.910
And I think there was a
subtext there that it was

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.500
employee review time for us.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.000
SURMA: Yeah.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.320
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
And it's done now.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:01.770
SURMA: Yeah.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.790
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So I
don't actually care.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.080
SURMA: No.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:03.760
Just unsubscribe.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.280
We don't care.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.155
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:06.169
We don't need you.

00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:06.960
SURMA: Please stay.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.543
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah,
please don't go.

00:09:08.543 --> 00:09:09.301
SURMA: Please.
