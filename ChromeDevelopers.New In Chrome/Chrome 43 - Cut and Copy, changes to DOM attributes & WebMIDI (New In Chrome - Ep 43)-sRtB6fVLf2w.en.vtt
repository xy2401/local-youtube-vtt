00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.740
Wouldn't it be great
if you could simply

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.280
copy something from the
web with a single click?

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.730
No more mousing over
text, then right clicking,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.400
and then clicking again to copy.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.310
Chrome 43 lets you
do it with one click.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.500
We've also moved DOM objects
to the prototype chain

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.790
to improve compatibility
across the web.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.710
As a bonus, you
can now use WebMIDI

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.790
to create great music in
the browser without a flag.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.570
These are just some of
the new developer features

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.830
available to you in Chrome 43.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.170
Let's take a look at
what's new in Chrome.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.410
Using the selection API to
programmatically select text

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.030
and document dot
execCommand copy,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.690
or document dot
execCommand cut, we

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.850
can make cutting or copying
text as easy as a single click.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.870
Then, once it's on
the clipboard we

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.630
can clear the selection with
window dot getSelection dot

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.360
removeAllRanges.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.950
Check out Matt Gaunt's post
about cut and copy commands

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.450
on HTML5 Rocks for
all the details,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.460
and let me know in
the comments if you've

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.590
added it to your site.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.750
To help improve
compatibility across the web,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.420
DOM attributes have moved
to the prototype chain.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.680
For many web developers, this
won't make any difference.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.020
But if you're using
hasOwnProperty on DOM objects

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.540
or using object dot
getOwnPropertyDescriptor on DOM

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.570
objects or serializing
DOM objects with JSON dot

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.190
stringify, you should
double check that things

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.380
are working as expected.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.050
This brings Chrome more
in line with the web

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.820
IDL spec and other
browers' implementations,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.200
such as Internet
Explorer and Firefox.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.450
It also increases the
hackability of DOM programming,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.770
making it easier to
implement polyfills

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.610
that efficiently emulate
functionality that's

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.380
missing in some browsers.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.840
Paul Kinlan has the
details spelled out

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.930
in this HTML Rocks article.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.340
Finally, Chrome 43 allows you
to connect many common music

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.870
instruments and controllers
to your browser,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.550
from keyboards and
DJ decks and mixers

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.580
to drum pads and FX
units with WebMIDI.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.110
Together with Web
Audio, it's now

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.720
possible to build complete
music production applications

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.300
on the web and control
virtual web instruments

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.840
with real controllers.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.490
Remember Jam with Chrome
or the Moog Doodle

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.240
from a couple years ago?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.230
Well, now they can
be made playable

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.810
with a musical keyboard
instead of a mouse.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.060
These are just a few
of the new features

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.780
for developers in Chrome 43.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.980
Thanks for watching and be
sure to subscribe to the Google

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.350
Developer channel.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.230
As soon as Chrome
44 is released,

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.880
we'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.
