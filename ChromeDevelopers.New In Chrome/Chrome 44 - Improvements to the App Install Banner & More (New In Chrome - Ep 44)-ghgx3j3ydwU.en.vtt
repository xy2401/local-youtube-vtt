00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.190
In Chrome 42, we introduced
app install banners

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.640
to make it quick and
seamless for Android users

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.230
to add your web app to
their homescreen with just

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.830
a single tap.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.080
But there was no way
to tell if they did.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.250
Well, now you can.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.940
There are some important
changes to the way Push works,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.050
and improvements
to notifications.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.150
Ready?

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.910
Then let's take a look
at what's new in Chrome.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.850
Starting in Chrome
44, Chrome fires up

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.440
before install prompt event--
before the app banner is shown.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.770
This event includes a
promise, named user choice,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.210
that is fulfilled after the user
has responded to the banner.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.710
The fulfilled promise
includes an outcome property

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.800
that you can use to determine
if the user's dismissed

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.270
or accepted the
banner, and added

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.630
your app to their homescreen.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.850
This is a great tool
for understanding

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.060
how your users interact
with the app install banner.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.990
You can also prevent the
banner from appearing

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.620
by calling preventDefault
on the event object.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.970
In the future, this will
allow you to defer the banner

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.210
until later.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.030
For example, after the user has
completed a specific action.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.700
One other tip-- if
you set the start

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.670
URL in your manifest to include
a query string like UTM source

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.930
equals manifest, you
can use analytics

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.210
to track how often
people are launching

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.940
your app from their homescreen.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.190
If you've been using
push notifications,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.930
there are few updates
to be aware of.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.300
You no longer need to
include GCM user visible

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.750
only true in the manifest file.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.550
Instead, this parameter is
moved to the subscribe method

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.470
on the ServiceWorker, and
is passed as a parameter

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.380
user visible only true.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.260
Also, the need for
subscription ID

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.550
has been removed from the spec.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.259
It's still available
in Chrome 44,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.500
but will be removed
from Chrome 45.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.540
Check out this link
for details on how

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.830
to deal with this until all
of your users have upgraded.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.670
One of the more useful
updates is the addition

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.070
of notification
data, which makes

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.240
it possible to
attach a JavaScript

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.910
object to the
notification, which

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.620
can be read when the user
clicks on the notification.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.580
In the past, if you wanted to
do this, it was rather ugly.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.760
You could either store
the data in the icon URL,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.740
or use something like index db.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.060
Yuck.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.790
Now, we can simply pull
the notification object out

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.500
of the notification.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.650
And poof!

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.220
I am a little tea pot.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.600
One of the common
requests we've heard

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.200
is that you want better
control over notifications,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.200
and how they're displayed.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.320
For example, rather than showing
23 different notifications--

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.100
one for each unread
chat message--

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.630
or only showing
the last one, you

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.510
can choose how to handle them,
potentially consolidating them

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.990
into a single message.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.690
Get notification
returns a promise

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.610
with an array of the
current notifications,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.110
allowing you to deal with
them programmatically

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.510
before the user gets annoyed.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.060
These are just a few of the
new features in Chrome 44

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.630
for developers.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.370
You can get more details from
the links in the description.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.000
I'm Pete LePage,
thanks for watching.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.380
And don't forget to subscribe to
the Google Developers channel,

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.040
because as soon as
Chrome 45 is released,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.450
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.800
