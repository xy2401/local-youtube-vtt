[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.950
Chrome 45 is rolling out now.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.600
There's new ATMOS script 2015
functionality, improvements

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.560
to app install banners,
and a new security

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.750
feature to ensure that no one
is messing with your code.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.090
From the Empire Hotel
in New York City,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.250
let's take a look at
what's new in Chrome.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.240
Over the past year, we've added
a number of new JavaScript

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.970
features, defined in the ATMOS
script 2015 specification,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.060
formerly known as ES6.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.990
In Chrome 45, we've added
support for arrow functions.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.750
Beyond the shorter
syntax, they eliminate

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.940
the need for dot
bind or the var self

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.540
equals this hack necessary
for anonymous functions,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.410
because they lexically
bind the this value.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.450
Arrow functions may take
some getting used to,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.200
but once you've
played with them,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.040
they become second nature.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.560
Jason Orendorff
has a detailed post

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.660
on arrow functions
on hacks.Mozilla.org.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.920
You can find the link in
the description below.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.670
There are new methods
on the array object,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.660
like from, of,
fill, find, and find

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.560
index, that make dealing
with arrays much easier.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.150
On Android, you can now defer
the add to the home screen

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.690
banner and show it at a
more convenient time, when

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.230
it doesn't interrupt
the application flow.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.700
Simply prevent
the default action

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.480
by calling preventDefault on
the before install prompt event

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.620
and save a reference
to the event for later.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.200
Then, when you're
ready, re-trigger

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.250
the prompt by calling
prompt on the stored event.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.920
We've also added the ability
to install native apps,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.940
directly from your site.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.300
It works in much the same
way as add to home screen.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.660
Your site needs to
be served over HTTPS,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.180
have a web app manifest file
that includes information

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.770
about your native app.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.510
Then, if a user visits your site
at least twice over a two week

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.130
period, they'll see the banner.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.930
Check the link in
the description

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.060
below for full details.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.230
Oh, perfect.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.386
Could I get the
fruit cup please?

00:02:30.386 --> 00:02:32.770
Awesome.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.920
To help protect users,
sub-resource integrity

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.430
provides a mechanism
for the browser

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.060
to verify that a
fetch resource has

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.240
been delivered without
unexpected manipulation.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.490
You can use this to mitigate
the risk of a compromised server

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.680
or ensure that only carefully
reviewed third party code

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.520
is executed.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.990
This helps to ensure that the
expected resource is used,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.080
not just any resource that
lives at a particular URL.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.190
The current spec
and implementation

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.010
covers only script and link
rel equals stylesheet elements.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.340
Once the file has
been retrieved,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.120
the browser compares
the hash of the file

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.760
to the hash provided
by the integrity

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.570
attribute of the element.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.200
If the hashes don't match,
the browser won't use it.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.970
Oh, perfect!

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.340
Hey, this isn't what I ordered.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.520
Oh, well.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.940

sub resource integrity,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.770

in the description below.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.520
These are just a few of the
new features in Chrome 45

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.880
for developers.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.690
You can get more details
in the links below.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.160
I'm Pete LePage and as soon
as Chrome 46 is released,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.240
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.360
But for now, it's time to grab
a drink and sit by the pool.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.410
