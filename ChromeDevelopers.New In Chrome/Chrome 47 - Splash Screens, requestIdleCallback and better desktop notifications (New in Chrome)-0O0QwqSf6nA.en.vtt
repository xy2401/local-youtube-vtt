00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.840
Chrome 47 automatically
generates a splash screen

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.160
for web apps launched from
the home screen on Android.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.930
You can defer script
execution until idle

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.530
with requestIdleCallback,
and push notifications

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.620
will automatically
dismiss on desktop.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.040
These are just a few
of the new features

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.600
for developers in Chrome 47.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.450
Let's dive in and see
what's new in Chrome.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.020
Making the web app
experience better

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.270
has been a major
focus for Chrome.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.200
To make it easier for users
to re-engage with your app,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.250
Add to Home Screen
puts your app directly

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.060
on the Android home screen.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.710
And you can customize
the way your app looks

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.530
when it's launched by
modifying the web app manifest.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.510
Adjusting colors, eliminating
the address bar, and more.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.710
In Chrome 47, a
dynamically generated

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.720
splash screen is shown
even while Chrome

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.330
itself is loading,
making your app

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.600
look that much more polished.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.800
In the past, users
typically saw a white screen

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.390
while waiting for
your app to load.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.840
The splash screen
is generated based

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.250
on a combination of
information from the web app

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.210
manifest, including the
app name, background

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.620
color, and the icons.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.380
Chrome will use the icon that
is closest to 128 device pixels.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.010
So on a 1x device,
that's 128 by 128 pixels.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.590
Or on a 2x device, it's
256 by 256, and so forth.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.060
Personally, I recommend
providing a 1x, a 2, a 3,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.430
and a 4x version of your icon.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.690
That'll make sure that you're
well covered for all devices.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.390
When a user launches your
app from their home screen,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.000
the splash screen is shown, and
once your app begins to draw,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.630
the splash screen disappears.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.760
One of the biggest problems
hurting critical path

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.500
is lots of JavaScript
executing at the wrong time.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980
If it's run at the
wrong time, for example,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.840
when the user scrolls the
page, or you append a Dom

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.430
element while the user
is tapping a button,

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.620
things can become unresponsive.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.990
RequestIdleCallback
changes that.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.100
In the same way that
requestanimationframe allows

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.470
us to schedule animations
properly and maximize

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.210
our chances of hitting 60
FPS, requestIdleCallback

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.360
will schedule work
when there's free

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.140
time, either at the
end of the frame

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.900
or when the user's inactive.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.630
Functions registered
with requestIdleCallback

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.330
are given a deadline and should
return before that timeline is

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.070
reached.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.720
Otherwise you'll introduce Jank.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.760
If there's still work
to do, the function

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.360
can register for another
requestIdleCallback

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.200
to continue the work during
the next idle period.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.170
RequestIdleCallback is
now available in Chrome

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.050
and is coming to
other browsers soon.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.810
In the meantime you can
check out the [? shim ?].

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.220
So give it a shot and let
us know what you think

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.980
by Tweeting us @ChromiumDev.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.830
Push notifications
powered by service workers

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.500
have been available
since Chrome 42.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.840
And we've heard from
users and developers

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.680
alike that on
desktop notifications

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.130
would remain visible until
the user dismissed them.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.400
Chrome 47 now automatically
dismisses desktop notifications

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.210
after about 20 seconds unless
you set requireInteraction true

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.050
when calling show notification.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.970
There are lots of other new
features for developers.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.640
For example, array
prototype includes,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.510
which simplifies checking
array membership.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.420
You can now innumerate cameras,
microphones, and speakers

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.000
with the
navigator.MediaDevices API.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.530
And prefixed encrypted
media extensions

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.685
are now disabled in favor
of un-prefixed EMEs.

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:05.060
These are just a few of the
new features in Chrome 47

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.710
for developers.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.140

of the other new features.
