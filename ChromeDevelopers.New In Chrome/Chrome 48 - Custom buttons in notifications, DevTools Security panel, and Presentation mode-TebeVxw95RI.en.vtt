00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.880
Chrome 48 allows users
to take immediate action

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.070
on notifications
with custom buttons.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.890
The new developer
tools security panel

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.230
makes it easier to debug
mixed content issues

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.850
and ensure your site is
properly served over HTTPS.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.010
And you can now add presentation
mode to mobile apps,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.850
easily casting content
to a second screen.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.729
These are just some
of them new features

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.180
for developers in Chrome 48.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.600
Let's dive in and see
what's new in Chrome.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.730
Until recently, reengaging
with users of your website

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.040
has been a challenge,
often involving bulk email.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.930
But browser-based
notifications changes that,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.070
allowing you to send users
timely, relevant notifications,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.370
for example, letting
them know that tickets

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.130
to their favorite
band are on sale

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.530
or about a new chat message.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.430
In Chrome 48 you can
now add custom buttons

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.510
to notifications, enabling users
to complete the task entirely

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.450
within the notification.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.610
Imagine that previous
example, a notification

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.350
that tickets to
your favorite band

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.690
just went on sale with
a "Buy Now" button.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.000
To add buttons to
your notifications,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.930
add an array of actions,
including a title and action

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.500
ID to the notification
info object.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.780
If the user clicks on
one of the actions,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.240
that information is passed in
the notification click event.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.590
Be sure to provide
buttons that are specific

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.200
and allow users to quickly
respond to the notification.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.510
And make sure that they're
different from the default

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.780
action.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.220
Peter [? Beverloo ?] has a cool
sample you can try at the URL

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.570
below.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.390
We all expect sites that deal
with our personal information

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.700
to be served over HTTPS.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.240
It's just standard practice.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.420
As we start to build
apps that take advantage

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.030
of powerful features,
like Service Worker,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.720
it's simple a requirement.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.950
Some APIs that we've used
for years without HTTPS,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.930
like geolocation
or device motion,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.620
may require secure
connections in the future.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.750
HTTPS helps to protect
the integrity of our apps

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.120
and our users' information.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.210
There's a new security
panel in developer tools

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.970
to help with this.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.850
At a glance, it tells you
whether the page is secure

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.330
or not and can help you
diagnose HTTPS issues.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.700
It shows information about
the certificate, the protocol

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.960
and cipher, and the status
of all of the sub-resources.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.460
To see how it works and
some of the different errors

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.800
it will help you debug,
open the new security panel

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.390
in developer tools, and
check out https://badssl.com.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.720
How often have you gathered a
group of friends or coworkers

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.570
around your phone to show them
the latest meme, or work video,

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.830
or something?

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.710
Wouldn't it be awesome
to be able to send it

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.520
to a second, larger screen,
directly from your phone?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.380
Chrome 48 on Android now allows
sites to present to Google Cast

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.650
devices, using the
standard space presentation

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.950
API and the Cast Web SDK.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.580
The presentation API allows you
to leverage a second display,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.990
while using your mobile
device as the controller,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.830
not only to move
between slides or choose

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.390
which video plays next, but
as a game controller or input

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.560
device.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.160
Imagine a racing game that
uses your phone as the steering

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.170
wheel or an interactive
tutorial to help students

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.920
improve their math skills.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.830
There are some other cool
new features in Chrome 48,

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.770
like network
information.downloadmax,

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.590
which provides the maximum
bandwidth of a device.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.530
One use case-- warn users
about a large transfer

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.020
on cellular networks
that might eat up

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.660
their allotted bandwidth.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.520
And there's the
new get.all methods

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.340
that simplify bulk
index DB interactions.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.529
These are just some of the
new features in Chrome 48

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:19.899
for developers.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.089
Be sure to check out
the description below

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:25.310
to get links to more
details and learn about some

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.070
of the other new features.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.990
If you haven't
already, subscribe

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.090

YouTube channel

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.880
to stay up to date
with the latest news.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.180
I'm Pete LePage, and as soon
as Chrome 49 is released,

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.580
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.130
