00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.550
Chrome 50 adds support for
payloads and push messages

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.300
and adds new features
to notifications.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.370
You can preload important
resources with the link

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.910
rel=preload tag and the canvas
element gets an upgrade.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.730
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 50.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.290
Push notifications
allow you to trigger

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.380
system-level notifications
in the same way

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.850
that native applications do.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.500
In Chrome 50, you can now
include an encrypted data

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.160
payload with the
push, eliminating

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.680
the need for the service
worker to fetch the data needed

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.410
for the notification.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.130
And it's already supported by
Firefox using the web push API.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.920
You can now dismiss
notifications across devices

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.880
when closed by the
user on one device

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.280
and you have more
control over how

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.120
notifications look and behave.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.290
You can set icons on actions,
set custom time stamps,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.390
and even specify whether the
device should vibrate or make

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.120
a sound.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.440
Have you ever wanted
to let the browser know

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.240
about an important font,
script, or other resource that

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.290
will be needed later without
delaying the onload event?

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.080
Chrome now supports the
link rel=preload tag.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.890
A W3C draft spec that allows
you to tell the browser which

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.960
resources should be
preemptively downloaded

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.620
and can reduce the time to
get real content on screen.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.460
Link rel=preload replaces
link rel=subresource,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.430
which had a number of bugs and
drawbacks and wasn't supported

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.740
by other browsers.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.640
The canvas element now
supports the toBlob method,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.580
which means instead
of manipulating

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.580
Base64 encoded strings that
you get from toDataURL,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.670
you can now work with the
encoded binary data directly.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.910
It's smaller and tends to fit
more use cases than a data URI.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.060
Not only can you more easily
upload them to your server,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.090
or store them in
IndexedDB for later use,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.010
you can draw the image blobs
to another canvas context

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.740
with the create image
bitmap API, supported today

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.570
in Chrome and Firefox.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.150
One other quick note.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.830
The geolocation APIs are
now only accessible when

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.930
served from a secure origin.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.760
These are just a few of
the changes in Chrome 50

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.090
for developers.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.260

I'm Pete LePage, and as soon
as Chrome 51 is released,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.310
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.
