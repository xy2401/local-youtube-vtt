PETE LEPAGE: Chrome 51
makes it easy to know

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.670
when an element enters or exits
the viewport with intersection

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.830
observers.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.560
You can make the sign-in
process way easier

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.250
with the new Credential
Management API.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.230
And you can reduce jank with
passive event listeners.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.440
I'm Pete LePage.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.870
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 51.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.477
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.220
Intersection observers let you
know when an observed element

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.390
enters or exits the
browser's viewport--

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.480
no more jank-inducing calls
to get bounding client rect

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.000
or listening for scroll events.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.830
To use, simply create a
new intersection observer,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.620
provide a callback,
and an options object.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.710
Then tell the observer
which elements to watch.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.470
Boom!

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.330
When the element enters
or exits the viewport,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.200
the callback is fired.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.570
Check the description below
for link to a demo, browser

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.849
support, and more.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.580
Creating, remembering,
and typing passwords

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.170
is a pain in the neck,
especially on mobile.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.200
Chrome 51 supports the
Credential Management API,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.850
a new W3C spec that
allows your site

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.100
to interact with the
browser's Credential Manager

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.070
and federated account services,
like Google and Facebook,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.810
improving the login experience.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.870
The API has three key methods--
navigator.credentials.get

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.100
to get the user's credentials
and initiate a sign-in flow,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.450
store to save the user's
credentials in the Credential

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.460
Manager, and require
user mediation

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.130
to disable automatic sign-in.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.390
There's more info about
the Credential Management

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.690
API, including a demo and
links to the docs, below.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.640
Did you know that simply
adding an empty touch event

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.340
handler to a page can
make scrolling janky?

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.040
Less than 20% of touch
events call prevent default,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.759
canceling the scroll.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.470
But because the browser doesn't
know if it'll be called or not,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.770
it has to wait for the
JavaScript to finish.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.520
Chrome 51 adds support for
passive event listeners,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.200
allowing you to declare
that an event listener won't

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.250
prevent a scroll, making it
easier to eliminate jank.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.970
These are just a few of
the changes in Chrome 51

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.080
for developers.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.360
Check the description
for more details.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.790
And be sure to
like and subscribe

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.110
so that as soon as
Chrome 52 is released,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.590
you'll know what's
new in Chrome.
