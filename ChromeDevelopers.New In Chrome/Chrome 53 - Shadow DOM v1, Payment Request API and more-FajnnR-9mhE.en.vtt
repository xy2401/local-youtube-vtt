PETE LEPAGE: You can
now easily create

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.450
encapsulated, reusable web
components with Shadow DOM v1.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.490
Mobile payments
become streamlined

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.270
with the Payment Request API.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.340
The Web Bluetooth API is
available experimentally

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.440
on some platforms as an origin
trial, and there's plenty more.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.570
I'm Pete LePage.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.150
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 53.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.216
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:31.610
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are
powerful development languages.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.590
But they can be difficult to
maintain in large code bases.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.810
And if your app embeds
third-party content,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.710
you need to ensure that
its included styles do not

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.670
affect other parts of your app.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.590
Chrome 53 supports
Shadow DOM v1,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.010
which allows an element to
encapsulate its style and child

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.620
DOM away from the main document.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.380
Shadow DOM v1 has some
significant changes from v0,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.030
and is broadly agreed upon
by major browser vendors.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.560
Chrome will support
both versions of the API

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.330
until enough of you
have moved to v1.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.470
Eric Bidelman has a great primer
on using Shadow DOM to create

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.430
self-contained, reusable web
components on Web Fundamentals.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.970
Check it out.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.840
Completing payments on the web
can be a cumbersome process

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.040
for users.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.410
Autofill has made it easier
to enter information.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.700
But trying to complete a
checkout form on mobile

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.730
is still a challenge.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.638
Chrome 53 on Android adds
support for the Payment

00:01:31.638 --> 00:01:36.960
Request API, a new spec from
the W3C that provides fast,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.860
seamless, and secure payments
on the web using a credit card

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.010
or other payment provider,
like Android Pay.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.760
It also lets users provide
a billing address, shipping

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.240
details, and other
payer information

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.350
without having to type anything.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.140
Expect to see support for
more platforms coming soon.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.680
But in the meantime, check
out Eiji's Payment Request API

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920
Integration Guide
on web fundamentals

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.880
at g.co/paymentrequestapi.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.790
The Web Bluetooth
API is available

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.570
experimentally on some
platforms as an origin trial,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.360
allowing sites to communicate
with nearby devices using

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.460
the Bluetooth Generic
Attribute Profile.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.880
Sites that send notifications
to Android devices running

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.360
Marshmallow or later
can now provide

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.490
the badge shown in the status
bar instead of the Chrome logo.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.870
And finally, Chrome
on Android now

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.100
allows muted videos
to begin playing

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.250
without user interaction.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.355
If the video was marked as muted
and has the autoplay attribute,

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:43.220
Chrome will start
playing the video when

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.800
it comes visible to the user.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.700
These are just a few of
the changes in Chrome 53

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.050
for developers.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.350
Check the description for
more details and links

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.600
to the documentation
and specifications.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.350

up-to-date with Chrome

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.820

or somewhere up there.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.930
Anyways, I'm Pete LePage.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.980
And as soon as Chrome
54 is released,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.360
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.410
