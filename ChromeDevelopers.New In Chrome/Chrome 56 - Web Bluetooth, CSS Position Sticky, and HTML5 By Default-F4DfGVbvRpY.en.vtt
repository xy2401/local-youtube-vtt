PETE LEPAGE: Web apps
can now communicate

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.500
with nearby Bluetooth
low energy devices

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.109
using the Web Bluetooth API.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.210
Position sticky
is back, making it

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.290
easy to create elements that
scroll normally until sticking

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.030
to the top of the viewport.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.560
And HTML5, by default,
is enabled for all users.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.760
I'm Pete LePage.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.240
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 56.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.860
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.000
Until, now the ability to
interact with Bluetooth devices

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.880
has been possible
only for native apps.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.150
With Chrome 56, your
web app can communicate

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.260
with nearby Bluetooth
low energy devices

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.840
in a secure and private manner
using the Web Bluetooth API.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.340
The Web Bluetooth API
uses the GATT protocol,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.770
which enables your app
to connect to devices

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.220
such as light bulbs, toys,
heart rate monitors, LED

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.990
displays, and more, with just
a few lines of JavaScript.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.970
Web Bluetooth can also be
combined with physical web

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.110
beacons to discover and
control nearby devices.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.660
Francois has a great
article on updates.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.210
And be sure to check out some
of the cool demos that go along

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.650
with it.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.960
Previously, building
content headers

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.240
that scrolled normally
until sticking

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.340
to the top of the
viewport required

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.520
listening to scroll
event and switching

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.660
an element's position
from relative

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.660
to fixed at a
specified threshold.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.540
It was difficult to
synchronize and often resulted

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.120
in small visual jumps.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.000
Chrome now supports
CSS position sticky,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.670
a new way to position elements.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.240
An element that is position
sticky starts relative,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.970
but becomes fixed after
the element reaches

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.890
a certain scroll position.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.080
Simply set position sticky
and set a threshold for it.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.420
Paul Kinlan has an
update post about it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.370
linked in the description.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.380
Last August, we
announced that we'd

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.280
be moving to HTML5 by default
to offer a safer and more

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.470
power-efficient experience.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.620
This change disables
the Adobe Flash Player

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.250
unless there's a user indication
that they want Flash content

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.020
on specific sites.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.320
And eventually, all websites
will require the user's

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.510
permission to run Flash.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.290
In Chrome 56, HTML5,
by default, has

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.600
been enabled for
all users, which

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.850
means that they will be
prompted to run Flash

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.130
on a site-by-site
basis for sites

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.530
that they've never
visited before.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.610
More details about how and
when users will be prompted,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.880
and recommendations on how
to test your Flash site,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.430
are linked in the
description below.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.650
Of course, there's plenty more.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.710
WebVR is available
as an Origin trial.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.310
The WebGL 2.0 API
is now available.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.660
And the Payment Request API
has a variety of new features.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.970
Check the description for
more details and links

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.770
to documentation
and specifications.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.590
If you want to stay
up to date with Chrome

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.750
and know what's coming,
be sure to subscribe

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.470
and follow ChromiumDev
on Twitter.

I'm Pete LePage.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.730
And as soon as Chrome
57 is released,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.690
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.040
