00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.280
PETE LEPAGE: Chrome
57 adds support

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.290
for display grid, a new CSS
grid layout specification.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.170
You can now customize
and respond to user input

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.750
on the lock screen and
notifications using

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.000
the new media session API.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.690
And there's plenty more.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.760
I'm Pete LePage.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.220
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 57.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.690
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.470
Flexbox is a
powerful layout tool.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.200
It makes many complex
layouts possible.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.820
But it can only do
layout in one dimension.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.350
Chrome 57 adds
support for display:

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.370
grid, the new CSS grid
layout specification,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.680
adding a powerful
new tool for creating

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.370
two-dimensional, grid-based
layouts, optimized

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.250
for responsive user
interface design.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.480
Elements within the grid can
span multiple rows or columns.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.060
And regions in a
CSS grid can also

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.350
be named, making the layout
code easier to understand.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.520
Surma has an updates post about
it, linked in the description.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.540
And when you're ready
to dive in deeper,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.440
check out Rachel Andrews'
gridbyexample.com site.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.680
One of the missing features
from web media applications

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.310
has been the ability to deeply
integrate with the core media

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.210
experiences on mobile devices.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.910
In Chrome for Android, you can
now customize the lock screen

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.870
and notifications with media
content using the new media

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.640
session API.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.790
By providing metadata to the
browser about the content being

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.300
played, you can create
rich lock screen messages

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.270
that include information
such as the artist, title,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.040
album name, artwork, and more.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.450
You can also listen for and
respond to user actions taken

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.260
on the lock screen or
notification, such as seeking

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.940
or skipping.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.500
If you want to get
started quickly,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.020
Francois has a great
updates post about it.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.740
Or check out the official
Chrome media session sample

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.480
repo on GitHub.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.030
Both are linked in
the description below.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.370
And there's lots more.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.860
There are some improvements
to the payment request API.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.600
You can specify the color
of the text input cursor

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.610
with a caret color property.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.190
Visual effects such as
line color and style

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.390
can be specified with new
text-decoration properties.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.660
The fetch API response
class now supports

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.940
the dot redirected
attribute to help

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.760
avoid untrustworthy
responses and reduce

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.490
the risk of open redirectors.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.420
All WebKit prefixed
IndexedDB global aliases

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.780
have been removed after
their deprecation in M38.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.720
And, one of my
favorites, new pad-start

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.350
and pad-end formatting
methods that simplify string

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.770
padding when aligning console
output or printing numbers

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.420
with a fixed number of digits.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.080
These are just a few of
the changes in Chrome 57

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.500
for developers.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.440
Check the description
for more details,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.870
and links to the documentation
and specifications.

58 is released,
