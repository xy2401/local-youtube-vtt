00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.660
PETE LEPAGE: The
IndexedDB 2.0 standard

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.610
is now fully
supported in Chrome,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.190
and features new schema
management, bulk action

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.030
methods, and more standardized
handling of failures.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.220
Progressive web apps
become more immersive,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.360
with display full screen,
allow top navigation by user

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.690
activation, give sandboxed
iFrames new powers,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.310
and there's plenty more.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.270
I'm Pete LePage.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.105
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 58.

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:28.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.080
The structure of
your site's database

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.730
has large performance impacts,
and can be difficult to change.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.730
IndexedDB 2.0 changes that.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.580
Updates, object
stores, and indexes

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.660
can now be renamed in
place after refactoring.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.720
Binary keys allow
for more natural keys

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.480
without worrying about
performance penalties.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.380
Data retrieval is easier
with GetKey, openKeyCursor,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.380
and continue primaryKey methods.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.410
And bulk recovery
of entire datasets

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.540
no longer needs a cursor
with getAll and getAllKey.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.280
When progressive web apps are
launched from the Android home

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.540
screen, they launch in a
standalone app-like mode

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.700
that hides the Omnibox.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.580
This helps create an
engaging user experience,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.460
and frees up screen
space for content.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.130
However, for even more
immersive experiences

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.550
like games, video players,
and other rich content,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.040
mobile UI elements
such as the system bar

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.460
can still be a distraction
and take up valuable pixels

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.200
that you may want.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.050
Now, you can make your
progressive web app feel more

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.560
immersive by setting
display:fullscreen in your web

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.180
app manifest.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.460
When your app is launched
from the home screen,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.020
all non-app mobile UI
elements will be hidden.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.910
Chrome 58 now supports
the new iFrame

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.830
Sandbox keyword, allow top
navigation by user activation.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.140
When triggered by
a user interaction.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.570
This keyword gives
sandboxed iFrames

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.230
the ability to navigate the
top level page while still

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.960
blocking auto-redirects.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.270
And of course,
there's plenty more.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.790
Say goodbye to
the clearfix hack.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.210
Instead of manually resetting
multiple layout properties

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.670
like float and
clear, you can now

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.400
add a new block
formatting context

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.350
using display flow-root.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.470
PointerEvents.getCoalescedEvents
allows you to access all input

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.430
events since the last time a
pointer event was delivered--

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.610
perfect for when you need
a precise history of points

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.980
for things like drawing apps.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.300
And workers and shared workers
can be created using data URLs,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.030
making development with
workers more secure

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.250
by giving them an opaque origin.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.890
These are just a few of
the changes in Chrome 58

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.250
for developers.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.980
Check the description
for more details,

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.950
including links to
the docs and specs.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.670
If you enjoyed this video, check
out the new Designer Versus

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.710
Developer video
series that tries

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.930
to solve the challenges
faced when designers

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.570
and developers work together.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.760
Then click the Subscribe
button, and you'll

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.260
get an email notification
whenever we launch a new video.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.090
I'm Pete LePage, and as soon
as Chrome 59 is released,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.820
we'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.
