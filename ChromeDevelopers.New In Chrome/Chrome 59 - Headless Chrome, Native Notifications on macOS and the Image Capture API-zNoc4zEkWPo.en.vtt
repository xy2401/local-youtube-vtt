PETE LEPAGE: Headless
Chrome allows

00:00:01.638 --> 00:00:03.960
you to run Chrome in an
automated environment

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.810
without a user interface
or peripherals.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.690
Notifications on Mac
will be shown directly

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.020
by the native Mac OS
notification system.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.720
You can now capture
full resolution photos

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.430
with the Image Capture API.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.990
And there's plenty more.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.310
I'm Pete LePage.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.444
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 59.

00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:27.710
A headless browser
is a great tool

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.800
for running automated tests
and server environments where

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.290
you don't need to see
the rendered output

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.390
or have a visible UI shell--

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.420
for example, using
Selenium for unit tests

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.010
against your
progressive web app,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.680
to create a PDF of
a Wikipedia page,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.560
or inspecting a
page with DevTools.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.610
Starting in Chrome 59, you
can now run headless Chrome.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.370
It brings all the modern web
platform features provided

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.920
by Chrome to the command line.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.220
Check out Eric Bidelman's
post on updates linked below

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.870
for full details.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.540
He's got an example on how you
can use it to convert pages

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.530
to PDF, dump the DOM, and how
to use it programmatically

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.820
in Node.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.570
Chrome has historically included
its own notification system

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.780
for Web and extension
developers to show notifications

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.010
to the user.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.500
But we've heard from
users and developers

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.190
alike that they want Chrome to
use the native OS notification

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.240
system.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.015
Starting in Chrome
59 on Mac OS, Chrome

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:28.520
will use the native
notification system,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.770
improving the user
experience and ensuring

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.520
that the notifications feel
more integrated in the platform.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.970
My personal favorite,
notifications will now respect

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.670
my do not disturb settings.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.490
Because of the way Mac
OS handles notifications,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.460
there are a few
low usage APIs that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.060
are now discouraged as they'll
result in a degraded experience

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.650
on Mac OS.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.780
Check out our updates
post linked below

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.610
for all the details.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.940
Capturing high res photos
in a web app can be hard.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.880
Either the user has to upload a
photo or they've already taken

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.910
or switch from the browser to
their camera, take the photo,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.940
switch back to the browser,
and upload the photo.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.150
With the new Image
Capture API in Chrome 59,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.750
you have full access to the full
resolution of the capabilities

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.820
of any available camera.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.160
The API provides
control of features

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.090
such as zoom, focus, contrast,
ISO, and even white balance.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.200
Check Sam's post on
updates for full details

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.690
and sample code that you can
use to get started right away.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.140
These are just a few of
the changes in Chrome 59

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.130
for developers.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.150
Of course, there's plenty more.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.280
Check the description
for more details,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.030
including links
to docs and specs.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.580
Now if you didn't make it
to Google I/O this year,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.350
I've put a few of my favorite
videos on the side there.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.780
So check those out.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.730
Then click the Subscribe
button and you'll

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.990
get an email notification
whenever we launch a new video.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.010
I'm Pete LePage, and as soon
as Chrome 60 is released,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.128
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in chrome.
