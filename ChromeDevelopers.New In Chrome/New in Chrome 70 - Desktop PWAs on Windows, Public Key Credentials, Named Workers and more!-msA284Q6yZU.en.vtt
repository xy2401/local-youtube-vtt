PETE LEPAGE:
Progressive Web Apps

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.910
are now supported on Windows.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.340
The Credential Management
API adds support

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.140
for Public Key Credentials.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.940
And you can now name Workers.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.230
I'm Pete LePage.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.110
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 70.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.780
Users can now install
Desktop Progressive Web

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.520
Apps on Windows.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.710
Once installed, they're
launched from the Start menu

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.990
and run like all
other installed apps

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.360
without an address bar or tabs.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.430
Service workers ensure that
they're fast and reliable.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.460
The app window experience
makes them feel

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.680
like any other installed app.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.780
Getting started isn't
any different than what

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.502
you're already doing today.

00:00:39.502 --> 00:00:40.960
All of the work
that you've already

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.910
done for your existing
Progressive Web App

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.040
still applies.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.280
If your app meets the
standard PWA criteria,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.090
Chrome will fire the
beforeinstallprompt event.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.240
Save the event.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.000
Then add some UI, like
an install app button,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.810
to your app to tell the user
that your app can be installed.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.120
Then, when the user
clicks the button,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.100
call prompt on the saved event.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.320
Chrome will then show
the prompt to the user.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.860
If they click Add, Chrome will
add your PWA to their start

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.110
menu and desktop.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.660
We're currently working
on Mac and Linux support.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.990
So check out my post
on desktop PWAs link

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.170
in the description
for complete details.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.545
The Credential
Management API makes sign

00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:26.070
in super simple for users.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.270
It allows your site to interact
with the browser's Credential

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.820
Manager or Federated
Account Services,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.730
like Google or
Facebook, to sign in.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.700
Chrome 70 adds a third
type of credential,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.800
Public Key Credential,
which allows

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.530
web apps to create
and use strong,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.880
cryptographically attested, and
application scoped credentials

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.340
to strongly authenticate users.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.200
I'm pretty excited
about it, because it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.360
allows sites to
use my fingerprint

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.490
for two-factor authentication.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.640
But it also adds support for
additional types of security

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.820
keys and better
security on the web.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.770
Check out the web
auth docs linked

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.020
in the description for more
details on how you can get

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.060
started.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.320
Workers are an easy way to move
JavaScript off the main thread

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.030
and into the background.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.790
This is critical to keeping
your site interactive,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.640
because it means that the
main thread won't lock up

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.430
when it's running expensive
or complex JavaScript

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.990
computations.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.680
In Chrome 70, Workers now
have a name attribute,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.170
which is specified by
an optional argument

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.040
on the constructor.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.680
This lets you distinguish
dedicated Workers

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.300
by name when you have multiple
workers with the same URL.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.270
You can also print the name
in the DevTools console

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.320
making it much easier to know
which Worker you're debugging.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.980
Naming Workers is already
available in Firefox, Edge,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.750
and Safari.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.970
These are just a few of
the changes in Chrome 70

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.820
for developers.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.810
Of course, there's plenty more.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.670
Web Bluetooth is now
available in Windows 10

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.420
and allows your site to
communicate with nearby user

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.530
selected Bluetooth devices in
a secure and privacy-preserving

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.850
way.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.330
Chrome can now send intervention
and deprecation messages

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.010
to your servers using the
report to HTTP response header,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.130
or service them in the
reporting observer interface.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.370
And there are a number
of important deprecations

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.790
that you should know about.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.110
Check the deprecations
post for more details.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.480
All the details,
including docs and specs,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.420
are in the updates post
linked from the description.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.000
Be sure to check out the latest
new in Chrome DevTools video

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.010
to learn what's new in DevTools.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.110
Then click the Subscribe
button, and you'll

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.590
get an email notification
whenever we launch a new video.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.720
I'm Pete LePage, and as soon
as Chrome 71 is released,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.510
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.
