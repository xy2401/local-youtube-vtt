PETE LEPAGE: Displaying
relative time values

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.260
is now part of the Intl.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.400
API.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.280
You can specify which
side of the text underline

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.980
should appear on for text
that flows vertically

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.010
and fewer surprises.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.980
I'm Pete LePage.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.950
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 71.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.200
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.950
Many web apps use phrases
like yesterday, in two days,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.070
or an hour ago to indicate
when something happened

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.370
or is going to happen instead
of displaying the full date

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.450
and time.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.780
Displaying relative times
has become so common

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.410
that most date/time libraries
provide localized functions

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.940
to handle this for us.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.880
In fact, with almost
every web app I build,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.180
moment.js is one of the first
libraries I add expressly

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.770
for this purpose.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.150
Chrome 71 introduces
Intl.RelativeTimeFormat,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.790
which shifts the work
to the JavaScript engine

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.720
and enables localized
formatting of relative times.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.880
This can give us a
small performance boost

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.360
and means we only need those
libraries as a polyfill

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.540
when the browser doesn't
support the new APIs yet.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.870
Using it is simple.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.820
Create a new instance and
specify the locale, then just

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.380
call format with
the relative time.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.870
Check out Matthias's
updates post linked below.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.250
When Chinese or Japanese text
is displayed in a vertical flow,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.820
browsers are inconsistent with
where the underline is placed.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.560
It may be on the
left or on the right.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.970
In Chrome 71, the text
underline position property

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.870
now accepts left or right
as part of the CSS3 text

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.460
decoration spec.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.540
The CSS3 text decoration spec
adds several new properties

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.630
that allow you to specify
things like what kind of line

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.440
to use, the style, the
color, and position.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.810
We've all been surprised
when we hit a site

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.290
and suddenly it
starts talking to us.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.050
AutoPlay policies prevent
sites from automatically

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.310
playing audio.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.050
These sites use the speech
synthesis API instead.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.620
Starting in Chrome 71,
the speech synthesis API

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.740
now requires some kind of
user activation on the page

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.300
before it'll work.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.810
This brings it in line with
other AutoPlay policies.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.610
If you try and use it
before the user has

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.940
interacted with the page,
it will fire an error.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.130
There's nothing worse
than going to a site

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.620
and having it surprise
you and the coworkers

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.450
sitting around you.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.030
These are just a few of
the changes in Chrome 71

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.910
for developers.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.000
Of course, there's plenty more.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.490
The element that requests
fullscreen method

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.950
can now be customized
on Android.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.270
The default credential mode
for module script requests

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.330
has changed from
omit to same origin.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.440
And bringing Chrome in line
with the Shadow Dom V1 spec,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.710
Chrome 71 now calculates
the specificity

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.180
for host, host context,
and slotted elements.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.760
If you didn't make it to Chrome
Dev Summit, or maybe you did,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.500
but you didn't
see all the talks,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.050
check out the Chrome
Dev Summit 2018 playlist

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.580
on our YouTube channel.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.710
Ewa and Phil went into
some neat techniques

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.280
for using service workers.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.540
Mariko and Jake talked
about how they built Swoosh.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.150
Katie and Houssein covered
some great techniques

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.460
to maximize the
performance of your site.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.510
And of course, there
are plenty more.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.940
So check them out.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.310
Oh, and click that
subscription button.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.550
You'll get an email notification
whenever we launch a new video.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.720
I'm Pete LePage.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.980
And as soon as Chrome
72 is released,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.770
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.
