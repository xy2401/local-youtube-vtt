PETE LEPAGE: In Chrome 72,
creating public class fields

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.790
in JavaScript is
now a lot cleaner.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.820
You can see if a page has been
activated with the new user

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.990
activation API, and localizing
lists becomes way easier.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.500
And there's plenty more.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.560
I'm Pete LePage.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.100
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 72.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.720
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.760
My first language was Java.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.440
And when I started
learning JavaScript,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.210
it threw me for a bit of a loop.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.430
How did I create a class,
or deal with inheritance?

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.720
What about public and private
properties and methods?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.180
Many of the recent
updates to JavaScript

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.120
make object-oriented
programming much easier.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.320
I can now create classes that
mostly work like I expect them

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.540
to, complete with
constructors, getters

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.620
and setters, static methods,
and public properties.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.880
Thanks to V8 7.2, which
ships with Chrome 72,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.180
you can now declare public
class fields directly

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.820
in the class definition,
eliminating the need

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.530
to do it in the constructor.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.160
Support for private class
field is in the works.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.950
Head over to Matthias's
article on class fields

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.820
for more details.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.630
Remember when sites could
automatically play sound

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.680
as soon as the page loaded?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.530
You had to scramble
to hit the Mute key

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.890
or figure out which tab
it was and close it.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.120
That's why some APIs require
activation via user gesture

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.740
before they work.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.440
Unfortunately, browsers
handle this activation

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.180
in different ways.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.020
Chrome 72 introduces
user activation v2,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.370
which simplifies user
activation for all gated APIs.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.290
It's based on a
new specification

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.020
that aims to standardize
how activation

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.450
works across all browsers.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.520
There's a new user
activation property

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.310
on both navigator
and message event

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.750
that has two properties-- has
been active and is active.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.010
Has been active indicates if
the associated window has ever

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.870
seen a user activation in
its life cycle, and is active

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.600
indicates if the
associated window currently

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.780
has a user activation
in its life cycle.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.435
We'll have a detailed
write-up on developers.googl

00:02:13.435 --> 00:02:18.760
e.com/web/updates shortly,
so keep an eye out for that.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.160
I really love the Intl APIs.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.590
They're super helpful
for localizing content

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.480
into other languages.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.030
In Chrome 72, there's
a new method that

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.880
makes rendering lists easier.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.730
Like other Intl APIs,
it shifts the burden

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.720
to the JavaScript engine
without sacrificing performance.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.530
Initialize it with the local
you want, then call format

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.950
and it'll use the
correct words and syntax.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.800
It can do conjunctions,
which adds the localized

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.810
equivalent of and, and look at
those beautiful Oxford commas.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.500
It can do disjunctions, adding
the localized equivalent of or,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.570
and by providing some additional
options, you can do even more.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.530
Check out Matthias's
post for more details.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.860
These are just a few of
the changes in Chrome 72

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.850
for developers.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.440
There's plenty more.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.160
Chrome 72 changes the
behavior of cache.addALL

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.110
to better match the spec.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.780
Previously, if there
were duplicate entries

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.990
in the same call, later
requests would simply

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.030
overwrite that first request.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.000
To match the spec if there
are duplicate entries,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.430
it will reject with an
invalid state error.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.290
Requests for fave icons are now
handled by the service worker

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.160
as long as the request URL is on
the same origin as the service

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.940
worker.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.720
And of course,
there's plenty more.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.830
So check them out.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.380
All the details,
including docs and specs,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.160
are in the updates post
linked in the description.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.950
Be sure to check out the latest
Chrome DevTools video to learn

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.720
what's new in DevTools.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.910
Then click the Subscribe
button and you'll

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.270
get an email notification
whenever we launch a new video.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.370
I'm Pete LePage, and as soon
as Chrome 73 is released,

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.340
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.
