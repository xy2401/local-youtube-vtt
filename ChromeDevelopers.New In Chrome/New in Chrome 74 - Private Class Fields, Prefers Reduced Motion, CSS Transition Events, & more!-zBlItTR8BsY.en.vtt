PETE LEPAGE: Just in
time for Google I/O,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.340
Chrome 74 is landing now.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.070
It adds support for
private class fields,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.820
allows you to detect when a user
has requested a reduced motion

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.540
experience, adds support
for CSS transition events,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.360
and of course, plenty more.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.420
I'm Pete LePage.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.160
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 74.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.460
Class fields
simplify class syntax

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.220
by avoiding the need for
constructor functions

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.850
just to define
instance properties.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.670
In Chrome 72, we added support
for public class fields,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.980
and I said private class
fields were in the works.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.570
I'm happy to say that
they've landed in Chrome 74.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.110
The new private field syntax
is similar to public fields,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.610
except that you
mark the field as

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.040
private by using a pound sign.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.370
Think of the pound sign as
being part of the field name.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.700
Remember, private fields
are just that-- private.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.300
They're accessible only inside
the class, but not available

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.070
outside the class body.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.810
To read more about public
and private class fields,

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.130
check out Mathias's post on
class fields linked in the post

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.840
below.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.150
Some users have reported
getting motion sick

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.720
when viewing parallax scrolling,
zooming, and other motion

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.770
effects.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.320
To address this, many
operating systems

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.920
provide an option to reduce
motion whenever possible.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.450
Chrome now provides a media
query, prefers-reduced-motion,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.790
part of the media
queries level 5 spec,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.450
that makes it easy to check
when this option is turned on.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.940
Imagine I have a sign-up
button that draws attention

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.920
to itself with a slight motion.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.800
The new query lets me
shut off the motion just

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.860
for that button.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.630
Check out Tom's article
on the new query

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.900
selector linked below.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.800
The CSS Transition specification
requires that transition events

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.530
are sent whenever a
transition is enqueued,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.860
starts, ends, or is canceled.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.370
The events have been supported
in other browsers for a while,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.150
but until now, they weren't
supported in Chrome.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.700
In Chrome 74, you can now
listen for transitionrun,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.440
transitionstart, transitionend,
and transitioncancel events,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.520
making it possible to
track or change behavior

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.220
whenever a transition is run.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.740
Feature policies allow
you to selectively

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.820
enable, disable, and modify the
behavior of APIs and other web

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.810
features.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.570
This is done either through
the Feature Policy header

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.400
or through an allow
attribute on an iframe.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.110
In Chrome 74, you can get
a list of features allowed

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.540
with the
allowedFeatures API, you

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.800
can check if a specific feature
is allowed with allowsFeature,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.960
and you can get
a list of domains

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.350
used on the current page
that allow a specific feature

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.500
with getAllowlistForFeature.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.080
Check out the Introduction
to Feature Policy post

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.160
for more details.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.550
These are just a few of
the changes in Chrome 74

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.520
for developers.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.580
Of course, there's plenty more.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.990
Personally, I'm pretty excited
about the KV storage API--

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.280
a new, fast, async key
value storage service that's

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.620
available as an origin trial.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.010
And don't forget-- Google
I/O is just a few weeks away,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.270
and we'll have lots of
great new stuff for you.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.100
So be sure to tune in and
watch, May 7th to the 9th.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.400
More details about I/O, the
features I mentioned, and more

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.490
are in the updates post
linked in the description.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.878
If you want a reminder
about the I/O videos,

00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:30.420
click the Subscribe
button and you'll

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.780
get an email notification
whenever we launch a new video.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.720
I'm Pete LePage, and as soon
as Chrome 75 is released,

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.700
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.
