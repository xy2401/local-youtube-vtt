PETE LEPAGE: Dark mode
comes to websites.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.640
Progressive Web Apps on
desktop get an install button

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.120
in the Omnibox.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.420
You can finally prevent
the mini-infobar

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.170
from appearing on
mobile, and plenty more.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.050
I'm Pete LePage.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.440
Let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in Chrome 76.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.060
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.520
In Chrome 76, we're
making it easier

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.180
for users to install Progressive
Web Apps on the desktop

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.910
by adding an install
button to the address bar,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.230
sometimes called the Omnibox.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.650
If your site meets the
Progressive Web App

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.430
installability criteria, Chrome
will show an install button

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.980
in the Omnibox,
indicating to the user

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.470
that your PWA can be installed.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.450
If the user clicks
the Install button,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.940
it's essentially the
same as calling prompt

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.430
on the
beforeinstallprompt event.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.580
It shows the install dialog,
making it easy for users

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.590
to install your PWA.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.380
On mobile, Chrome
shows the mini-infobar

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.020
the first time a
user visits your site

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.020
if it meets the Progressive Web
App installability criteria.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.870
We heard from you
that you want to be

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.930
able to prevent that
mini-infobar from appearing

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.560
and provide your own
install promotion instead.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.070
Starting in Chrome 76,
calling preventDefault

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.700
on the beforeinstallprompt
event will stop the mini-infobar

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.170
from appearing.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.630
Be sure to update
your UI to let users

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.150
know that your PWA
can be installed.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.450
There's a great post linked in
the description with patterns

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.730
for updating your
UI and promoting

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.610
the installation of your PWA.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.490
When a Progressive Web App
is installed on Android,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.750
Chrome automatically requests
and installs a WebAPK.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.360
After it's been installed,
Chrome periodically

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.240
checks to see if the web
app manifest has changed.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.570
Maybe you've updated
the icons, colors,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.130
or changed the app name.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.120
And it checks to see if
a new WebAPK is required.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.520
Starting in Chrome
76, Chrome will

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.830
check the manifest
more frequently--

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.550
checking every day instead
of every three days.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.890
If any of the key
properties have changed,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.509
Chrome will request and
install a new WebAPK,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.160
ensuring the title, icons,
and other properties

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.640
are up-to-date.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.460
Check my post linked
in the description

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.740
for complete details.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.810
Many operating
systems now support

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.230
a dark mode or dark theme.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.990
The prefers-color-scheme
media query

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.300
allows you to adjust
the look and feel

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.720
of your site to match the
user's preferred mode.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.780
Tom has a great article
on web.dev with everything

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.140
you need to know, plus tips
for architecting your style

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.230
sheets to support both
a light and a dark mode.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.620
These are just a few of
the changes in Chrome 76

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.620
for developers.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.710
Of course, there's plenty more.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.300
Personally, I'm really excited
about promise.allSettled.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.820
It's similar to
promise.all, except it

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.380
waits until all of the promises
are settled before returning.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.680
Blobs are easier to read
with three new methods--

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.350
text, arrayBuffer, and stream--

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.990
and it means we don't
have to create a wrapper

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.700
around FileReader anymore.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.730
And we've added
support for images

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.190
to the asynchronous
clipboard API,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.100
making it easy to
programmatically copy and paste

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.330
images.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.070
All the details,
including docs and specs,

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.910
are in the updates post
linked in the description.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.610
Be sure to check out the latest
Chrome DevTools video to learn

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.260
what's new in DevTools.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.480
Then click the Subscribe
button, and you'll

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.820
get an email notification
whenever we launch a new video.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.780
I'm Pete LePage, and as soon
as Chrome 77 is released,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.970
I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome.
