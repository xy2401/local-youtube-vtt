ROB DODSON: Hey
there, polycasters!

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.200
Rob here, interrupting your
regularly scheduled program

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.194
to bring you this.

00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:10.610
It's the Chrome
Developers Summit,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.974
and it's going on right
now, unless you're

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:14.140
watching this in the future.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.556
But either way,
all of the content

00:00:15.556 --> 00:00:18.440
is available up on the Chrome
Developers YouTube channel.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.390
We've got talks from
Paul Lewis and Paul Irish

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.920
on building performant
web apps, Alice Boxhall

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.800
talks about accessibility,
and Taylor Savage

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.870
and yours truly about
building progressive web

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.802
apps using Polymer.

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.510
So definitely go check
that out, and I'll

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.718
catch you back here next
week for a brand-new episode

00:00:31.718 --> 00:00:32.880
of Polycast.
