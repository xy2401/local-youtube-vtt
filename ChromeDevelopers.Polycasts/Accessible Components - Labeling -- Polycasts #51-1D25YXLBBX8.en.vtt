00:00:03.892 --> 00:00:05.350
ROB DODSON: Hey
there, Polycasters.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:05.850
Rob here.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.730
Welcome back to the show.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.030
So today, we're going to
complete our three-part series

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.620
on building
accessible components

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.086
by talking about labeling.

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:14.230
Labeling is super
important for accessibility

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.100
because it allows us to tell
the user what a control is for.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.880
And let me show you an example
to explain what I mean by that.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.360
So over here, I've
got JS Bin set up.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.220
And I'm just going
to start creating

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.850
a bit of a form element.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.080
So I'll drop in an input tag.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.370
And you can see, cool,
I've got a text input.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.580
What am I going to ask
the user for, though?

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.460
Well, I'll add a label.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.050
And I'm just going to wrap
that label around the input.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.170
And I will say, hey,
I would like to know

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.650
the user's shipping address.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.130
So anyone filling out a
form who is a sighted user

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.830
will be able to go
through and see, OK,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.955
there's a text input field.

00:00:50.955 --> 00:00:51.870
There's a label here.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.530
I'm assuming these
two are associated.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.647
And because I have used
nice, semantic HTML

00:00:56.647 --> 00:00:58.730
and I've built this
relationship between the label

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.570
element and the
input, check out what

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.021
happens to my screen reader
when I interact with this thing.

00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:05.479
SCREEN READER:
VoiceOver on Chrome,

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.110
check Shipping
Address, edit text.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.818
ROB DODSON: Nice.

00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:10.160
So we've created that
alternative interface

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
for our users who
rely on screen readers

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.620
because we've built this
nice, semantic relationship.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.360
Now, the tricky bit here is
that the label element only

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.520
works with a handful of tags.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.610
So if we're building
a custom element,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.200
we're going to have to come up
with our own way of labeling

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.720
it and providing that sort of
accessible name to our users.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.950
So let's go check out the
ARIA Authoring Best Practices

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.810
guide to maybe get some hints
on how we could do this.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.310
So switching over
to that document,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.976
I'm going to go to
the Checkbox section.

00:01:36.976 --> 00:01:38.606
And if I scroll
down to the bottom,

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:39.980
the second bullet
point here says

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.470
that the checkbox should have
an accessible label, preferably

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.490
provided by a visible
label associated

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.947
using aria-labelledby.

00:01:46.947 --> 00:01:49.280
Now, we haven't really talked
about aria-labelledby yet,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.738
but now seems like a really
great time to cover that topic.

00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:54.890
So in the world of ARIA,
there's really three ways

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.200
that we can label something.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.920
There's aria-label,
sort of the singular,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.790
which is for basically applying
a text alternative directly

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.850
to an element.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.010
There's aria-labelledby,
where we can actually

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.820
have another element and sort
of reference that element

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.210
and use that as our label.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.570
And then in some
instances, we can actually

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.080
generate a label or a name
for an element just based

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.270
on its content.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.610
And we're going to cover
all three of those today.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.360
So let me start by talking about
aria-label because that one's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.560
pretty easy and
straightforward to explain.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.070
I'm going to switch
over to my code editor.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.950
And here is our dash checkbox
from the previous episode.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.850
And I'm just going to give
it an aria-label attribute.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.640
And we'll say the value
is going to be Sign Up.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.770
So we're assuming the
user checks this checkbox

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.760
and they're signing
up for something.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.060
So we switch over to Chrome.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.780
We refresh the page.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.840
Now, if we look at this
checkbox now in the dev tools,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.880
we can see that aria-label
has been applied here.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.580
And let's check out what happens
when I interact with this

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.977
using my screen reader.

00:02:54.977 --> 00:02:55.935
SCREEN READER: Sign up.

00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:57.615
Uncheck checkbox.

00:02:57.615 --> 00:02:59.990
ROB DODSON: So you heard the
screen reader say, "Sign up.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.950
Uncheck checkbox," right?

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.230
It has generated a name based
on that aria-label attribute.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.450
But we don't have a
visible label on screen.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.550
So we could add a visible
label on screen using something

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.370
like a span, but now we're kind
of duplicating our work there.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.430
Maybe a better approach
would be to use something

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.830
like aria-labelledby.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.480
So let me show you
how that works.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.320
We'll go back to
our code editor.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.000
We'll get rid of this
aria-label attribute.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.840
I'm going to add a span here.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.800
I'll say "sign up" in that span.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.290
And the way
aria-label works is it

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.170
takes an ID reference
to another element

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.280
to use that as its label.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.260
So I'll give span
here an ID of sign

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.820
up label, something like that.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.370
And then we'll take
our dash checkbox

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.690
and we'll say aria-labelledby
equals sign up label.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.020
So now we've linked these two
together by that ID reference.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.640
We go back.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.709
We refresh the page.

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.000
You can see the CSS, the
height is a little off, right?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.375
This thing is not
quite centered.

00:03:57.375 --> 00:03:58.460
That's easy enough to fix.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.010
But we do have a visible label
on screen now, which is good.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.520
And let's look at
what happens when

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.329
we activate our screen reader.

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.370
SCREEN READER: VoiceOver
on Chrome, dash sign up.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.537
Uncheck checkbox.

00:04:07.537 --> 00:04:10.120
ROB DODSON: So you heard there
that now it's saying, "Sign up.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.110
Uncheck checkbox."

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.610
OK.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.360
This is great.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.450
This is basically what we want.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.420
But it is a little
burdensome to have

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.839
to ask everyone who's using our
checkbox to also include a span

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.029
and create this label
linkage between the two.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.570
One final approach
that we could take

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.460
is to actually have
the checkbox's name

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.815
generated by its content.

00:04:26.815 --> 00:04:29.040
Now, this works for
smaller elements--

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.260
a checkbox, a radio button,
something like that.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.740
It wouldn't work so well
for really large elements,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.934
like an article or some
big landmarks like that.

00:04:36.934 --> 00:04:39.100
But for something really
small, a little controlled,

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.770
this technique could work.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.910
So going back to
my code editor, I'm

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.270
going to get rid of that span.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.790
I'm going to get rid of
the aria-labelledby here.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.550
So we'll nuke these.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.270
And we'll go to our dash
checkbox definition.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.620
And right now, we're
using the host selector

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.850
to draw a rectangle
around our element.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.900
And then when it is
aria-checked true,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.040
we're putting a little
check mark inside of it.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.370
And so we're going to
need to add a little bit

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.200
of additional markup.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.700
We're going to need
to actually have

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.182
that rectangle and that
checkbox over in a container.

00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:12.640
And then we're going to need
to have another element, which

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.550
will act as our label.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.930
So I'm going to add a
little bit of HTML here.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.754
Let's see.

00:05:17.754 --> 00:05:19.800
So I'll drop in a div.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.690
I'll call this first
div-- let's see.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.169
We'll call it
checkbox container.

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.960
That's going to hold
our actual check mark.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.800
I'm going to make
another div here.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.310
And we'll call this
one-- let's see.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.790
We'll do checkbox label.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.710
And then I'm just going
to replace the CSS

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.980
that I have here with some
updated CSS, some updated

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.597
styles.

00:05:42.597 --> 00:05:44.180
Let's walk through
these really quick.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.440
So what I've done is
I've kept the host

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.700
style of just making sure this
whole element is inline block.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.910
The checkbox container
now has the styles

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.750
for drawing our rectangle.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.060
When the host has
aria-checked applied,

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.560
the checkbox container
will actually

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.080
get the check mark inside of it.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.560
And then the
checkbox label, we're

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.559
just differentiating it
by bumping the font size

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:05.750
up a little bit and making
sure that both of these

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.540
are set to vertical
align middle.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.240
So that way, the
text and the checkbox

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.680
look nice and centered.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.950
The last thing I want to do is
inside of this checkbox label,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.240
I'm going to add
a content element.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.160
And what this is going to let
me do is in my index file inside

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.200
of dash checkbox, now I can
just write my label right

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.880
inside the element like that.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.924
It's going to project that
into that element's shadow dom.

00:06:30.924 --> 00:06:32.840
And then the browser
should be able to compute

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.270
the element's name or its
label based on that content.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.430
So let's check that out.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.780
We'll go back to Chrome.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.880
We'll refresh the page.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.838
You can see that the text
is little bit bigger.

00:06:41.838 --> 00:06:42.710
It's centered now.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.752
We turn on our screen reader
and let's see what happens.

00:06:45.752 --> 00:06:47.210
SCREEN READER:
VoiceOver on Chrome.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.709
Sign up.

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:49.005
Uncheck checkbox.

00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:50.130
ROB DODSON: So there we go.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.350
We've got a slightly
nicer, easier way

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.890
to give our user a label.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.390
Another really cool
thing about this

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.800
is that since the label is
now inside of the element

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.160
itself, when I
click on the label,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.274
it also focuses and
activates the element.

00:07:02.274 --> 00:07:03.690
And this is something
that you see

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.680
with native elements, native
input, native checkbox, when

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.080
you associate them with
a native label element.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.380
So now we've created a
very similar association

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.214
with our custom element
here, which is really nice.

00:07:14.214 --> 00:07:15.630
So that about
covers it for today.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.050
There's always more
to talk about when

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.190
we touch on accessibility.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.420
But hopefully now you
have a better foundational

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.070
understanding of how these
things work in the platform.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.390
If you have any more
questions, though, I'm

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.280
always happy to answer them.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.840
So please leave them for me
down below in the comments.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.173
Or you can reach me on a
social network of your choosing

00:07:30.173 --> 00:07:31.454
at #AskPolymer.

00:07:31.454 --> 00:07:33.162
As always, thank you
so much for watching

00:07:33.162 --> 00:07:34.500
and I'll see you next time.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.950
