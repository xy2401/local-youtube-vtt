ROB DODSON: Hey everyone,
what's up, it's Rob.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.940
Welcome back to the show.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.814
So I got on Twitter
recently and I

00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:11.480
asked folks, what
would they like to see

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.100
in upcoming Polycasts.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.380
And kind of resoundingly,
a lot of folks

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.419
said they want to
see more Firebase.

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:19.460
So I thought it would be
cool to kind of kick off

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.350
a multi-part series
where we talk

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.260
about how you can integrate
Polymer and Firebase together

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.820
into your projects.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.880
So today, what we're going
to do is just get started.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.400
We're going to set up a
very simple Firebase project

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.230
and we're going to do some
Firebase authentication.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.320
So follow me over
here to my laptop.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.030
And the first thing
I'm going to do

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.113
is I'm going to go to
console.firebase.google.com.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.820
You'll want to have
a Google account

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.350
already that you can sign into.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.440
So I've signed into my
personal account here.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.507
And I'm going to create a new
project for my Firebase app.

00:00:52.507 --> 00:00:54.590
And this is going to let
me do all sorts of really

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.200
cool things.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.960
I can do hosting
with Firebase, I

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.590
can do database work with
Firebase, authentication, et

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.220
cetera.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.220
I got to give it a name.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.090
So I'm going to
call this poly-fire,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.630
or something like that.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.835
And we'll create that project.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:09.710
Firebase will go off.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.480
It'll think for a second.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.260
The hamster wheels
are spinning up.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.980
poly-fire is getting created
and released into the world.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.480
OK.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.110
Cool.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.540
After that's done, you're
going to see a dashboard that

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.200
looks kind of like this.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.460
And there's a bunch of
options and things right here.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.960
It can be a little
bit overwhelming.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.610
But we're going to start
off really, really small,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.151
and the only thing that we're
going to really deal with today

00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:32.210
is authentication.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.150
And so what I want to do is
click on this authentication

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.330
tab, and it's going to ask
me, up here at the top,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.130
what sort of sign
in methods I would

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.960
like to allow in this app.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.630
Now being a Googler,
I got to represent.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.570
So I'm going to
enable Google sign in.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.340
And we just flip this little
switch and click Save.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.840
And what this is
going to let us do,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.460
is anybody who's got
a Google account will

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.126
be able to hit a sign
in button and sign

00:01:57.126 --> 00:01:59.360
in through that account
in our Firebase app.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.250
The other thing
that we need to do,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.430
is we need to go over
here to our settings,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.750
go to Project
Settings, and we're

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.800
going to need this web API
key that I'm copying here.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.410
Otherwise our authentication
will not work.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.010
So copy that.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.810
OK.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.950
So I think that's
basically everything we

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.060
need in the Firebase console.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.660
There's a ton more
that you can do here.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.460
And we're going to cover that
in some of future episodes.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.520
But for now, we're
pretty much ready to go

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.140
with just the default setup.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.360
So the next thing I want
to do is switch over

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.310
to my command line.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.460
And I've already gone ahead
and created a directory

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.110
to hold my demo application.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.420
And Firebase also provides
a really useful set

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.030
of command line tools that you
can install that will go ahead

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.905
and scaffold a project for you.

00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:41.780
So if you don't have
those installed already,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.725
you can do npm install
-g firebase-tools.

00:02:46.747 --> 00:02:49.080
That'll go out, fetch all
that stuff, set it up for you,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.821
so you'll now have
a Firebase command.

00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:52.904
I've already got those
installed so you don't have

00:02:52.904 --> 00:02:54.150
to watch me do any of that.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.800
So what I'm going to do, is
I'm going to run firebase init.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.509
And it's going to put a
very rad emoji on my screen.

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:03.800
And then it's going to ask
me some questions about what

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.940
sort of Firebase
features I would

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.196
like to have in this project.

00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:08.570
Firebase provides a real time
database, which is awesome,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.850
and we will be using that,
so we'll leave that checked.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.350
And then we've got
Firebase hosting.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.670
And that lets us basically just
do hosting of static assets.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.870
We can host our entire site
on Firebase if we want.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.920
So I will leave that
in there as well.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.010
I'll hit enter.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.880
It's going to ask
us what project

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.230
we want to associate with.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.090
So since we just created
that one called poly-fire.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.640
Here I'll move this
up a little bit,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.120
this is a little easier to see.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.780
So we will associate
with poly-fire.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.060
What file should be
associated with the database?

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.924
We'll just use the default
value there database.rules.json.

00:03:37.924 --> 00:03:39.340
What directory do
you want to use?

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.460
We'll say our public one.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.334
And then it's going to
ask if Firebase should

00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:44.360
sort of configure
its local server

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.100
rules to direct
everything to index.html?

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.230
So if we were building
a single page web app.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.230
I'm going to say yes, I
would like that feature,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.610
because that's pretty cool.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.800
And at that point,
it's basically done.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.330
And if we go ahead and we open
this up in our code editor,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.560
we'll see that this has
started to kind of scaffold

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.940
some things out for us.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.140
So I've got these
firebase.json, firebaserc file

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.120
that points to my project
name, stuff like that.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.520
This is all just configuration
to make Firebase work.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.520
What we're mainly going
to be working with today

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.020
though is this public directory.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.321
So this is where our
code is going to live.

00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:19.820
The other nice thing that we
can do with the Firebase tools,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.500
is we can start up
a local dev server.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.647
So we'll say firebase serve.

00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:26.480
And it's actually going
to look at the rules

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.146
that we have in our
firebase.json there.

00:04:28.146 --> 00:04:30.260
That tells it to serve
our public directory.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.849
So we can then just
open up localhost:5000.

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.640
And you'll see a page
that looks like this.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.340
Letting you know that your
local instance of Firebase

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.030
is working.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.540
Cool.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.040
All right.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.790
The next thing we
want to do, is we

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.160
want to go ahead
and install Polymer,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.500
and we want to
install Polymer Fire.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.180
Which is a set of
Polymer elements

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.820
that work specifically
with Firebase.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.170
So, because I want everything to
live in this public directory,

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.140
I'm actually going to
create a bowerrc file.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.100
So I'll create a .bowerrc file.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.900
So .bowerrc.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.570
RC And I will use
this to tell bower

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.640
to install all my stuff
into that public dir.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.900
So I will say, directory
is public/bower_components.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.580
Cool.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.104
And then in my
terminal, bower init.

00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:22.520
Yeah, it'll ask us a bunch of
questions about our project,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.600
we can just use the default
values, that's fine.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.390
And then we will
bower install --save.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.727
We will definitely
want Polymer/polymer.

00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:30.435
We're going to want
firebase/polymerfire.

00:05:33.306 --> 00:05:35.555
And we're going to want
Polymer Elements/paper-button.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.900
All right, so that's
going to go out and fetch

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.590
all of those resources and dump
them into our public directory.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.360
Finished pretty
quickly, which is good.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.706
And now we're basically ready
to start building our app.

00:05:49.706 --> 00:05:51.080
And remember the
goal of this app

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.530
is to basically have sort
of a simple sign in flow

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.230
for the user.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.389
So all I'm going to build
today is a button, that when

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.680
you click on it, it'll take
you through the o-auth flow

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.210
for Google sign in.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.550
And when the user is
actually signed in,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.620
it'll just like display
their name on screen.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.280
That way we know we at least
have something working there.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.419
So, let's go into
our index.html file.

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.960
And there's a bunch of code here
that Firebase sort of set up

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.570
for us that I'm just going
to go ahead and delete

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.649
because I don't really
need any of this stuff.

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:20.690
So we'll get rid of that.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.340
We'll get rid
everything in the body.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.120
And make this a
little bit bigger.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.744
We'll rename this Firebase
Auth or something like that.

00:06:26.744 --> 00:06:28.660
And because we're using
Polymer, because we're

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.451
building a Polymer app,
I want to start off

00:06:30.451 --> 00:06:33.530
by creating just a my app
element, that can sort of hold

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.730
all of my logic.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.370
So I'll have a
my-app element here.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.210
And I'm going to make
sure to include an HTML

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.142
import for that.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.340
So we're going to
ask for my-app.html.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.150
OK.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.550
And inside of this my-app
element, my-app.html,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.691
we're going to want to import
some of the Polymer Fire

00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:00.190
elements.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.340
So let's go check
those out really quick.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.048
So we'll going to
beta.webcomponents.org.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.760
This is the new
catalog where you

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.170
can find all sorts of
interesting, custom elements.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.880
The ones that I'm looking
for are called polymerfire.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.402
So go check these out.

00:07:17.402 --> 00:07:19.860
So this is a suite of elements
created by the Firebase team

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.340
specifically for Polymer.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.580
And you can see here that
basically what we want

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.590
is this firebase-app
element, and we're

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.479
going to combine it with
this firebase-auth element.

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:31.020
So when I bower installed these,
I got both of these already.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.030
But you can sort of see the
signature for how these work.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.980
Here, I'll bump this up a
little bit so you can read that.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.090
So you create a
firebase-app element.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.010
You basically tell
it about your domain,

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.466
you give it that API key
that we copied earlier,

00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:42.090
and you create a
firebase-auth element,

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.730
and that'll tell you when
your user is signed in or not.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.230
Right.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.660
So far so good.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.990
So in our my-app
element, over here.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.760
I basically want to
create an element that's

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.692
going to hold that
firebase-app element.

00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:57.900
So I've got some code here
that I've already written.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.730
Kind of stolen from
another project.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.330
And let's go through and we'll
update this a little bit,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.790
I can explain what's happening.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.080
So I've got a dom-module
from my-app element.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.980
I got this firebase-app
element inside of here.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.580
And I want to give it the
domain for my project.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.769
So if we go back to Firebase,
we go back to the console,

00:08:15.769 --> 00:08:18.060
we look at our project
settings, what it actually wants

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.020
is this Project ID right here.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.504
So it says Polymer fire,
or poly-fire-11d42.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.920
So that's what
we're going to use.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.450
So our auth-domain is going
to be poly-fire-11d42.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.860
Our database URL, even though
we're not using it yet,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.510
we can go ahead and set that up.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.590
And then our API key is going
to be that one that we copied.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.599
So get rid of that and
we'll drop in the API key

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.280
that we copied there.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.350
And the last thing
I'm going to do,

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.330
is I'm going to have
this log in element

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.377
that I'm going to create.

00:08:46.377 --> 00:08:48.960
But essentially this is all that
my app is going to do for us.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.727
It's going to set up the
connection to Firebase app,

00:08:51.727 --> 00:08:54.060
and then it's going to have
a little log in element that

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.060
will sort of toggle on and off.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.040
Let's go ahead and create that.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.345
Create a my-login.html.

00:09:01.345 --> 00:09:02.970
So again, I've got
a little bit of code

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.844
that I'm going to steal
and drop in here just

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:07.370
to start to scaffold
out my log in element.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.270
What I want to do, is
I want to make sure

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.670
that I am importing the
Firebase app elements.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.330
I'm going to steal
this link tag here.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.740
I don't have it in
any of my snippets

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.323
now that I'm using
Visual Studio Code.

00:09:18.323 --> 00:09:20.492
It's making me like the
world's slowest developer.

00:09:20.492 --> 00:09:22.950
So if anybody wants to create
a Visual Studio Code snippets

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.900
package for Polymer.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.190
I would totally be
your best friend.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.530
What we're going to do
is we're going to import

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:33.237
bower_components/, is it
polymerfire I believe.

00:09:33.237 --> 00:09:34.320
polymerfire/firebase-auth.

00:09:36.731 --> 00:09:37.230
All right.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.646
So
polymerfire/firebase-auth.html.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.810
And we're also going to
pull in the paper button.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.560
We'll have
paper-button/paper-button.html.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.890
Uh huh.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:55.910
It's looking good.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.020
Inside of our template
I'm going to drop

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.970
in a firebase-auth element.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.560
This is the basic signature
for a firebase-auth element.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.980
I want to give it
an ID because I

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.650
am going to need to reference
it in JavaScript a little bit.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.480
And then it's got
a user property

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.850
that we are going to expose
to the outside world using

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:12.570
this binding.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.760
So we're just going to
have a thing called user.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.845
It's also got this value
called status-known

00:10:16.845 --> 00:10:17.970
which could be interesting.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.830
It's a boolean that
tells you whether or not

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.190
you can assert the presence
of a user, and whether

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.860
or not you're allowed to
check the user object.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.939
So I'm including it here.

00:10:26.939 --> 00:10:28.980
I'm actually not going to
use it in my code today

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.320
because, I'll be 100%
honest, I'm not entirely sure

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.960
if I need to use it in my code.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.630
But I am including i there
just so you know about it.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.296
Maybe in the next
episode we'll discover

00:10:36.296 --> 00:10:37.750
if it's actually useful or not.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.520
But I'm just going
to drop it in there

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.170
so it's on everyone's radar.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.000
And lastly we have
this provider value.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.584
Which I'm just going
to set to Google.

00:10:43.584 --> 00:10:45.291
Because if you remember,
we went through,

00:10:45.291 --> 00:10:46.710
and when we were
in our dashboard,

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.814
we set up the authentication
method as, sign in with Google.

00:10:49.814 --> 00:10:51.480
The next thing we
need to do, is we need

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.390
to drop in some paper buttons.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.010
Here all close the side bar so
you can see this a bit easier.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.500
So you have a paper
button here, it's raised,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.600
so it'll have a bit
of a drop shadow.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.080
And when the user taps it, it's
going to run a log in method,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.970
and I've got this
little thing that I'm

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.490
doing here where I'm hiding
the button if there is a user

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:09.990
present.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.940
So if the user is
already signed in,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.072
let's not show the
sign in button, right?

00:11:14.072 --> 00:11:16.530
And I've got basically the
exact same thing going down here

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.460
for this other button.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.260
This will be our log out button.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.340
And we just sort
of flip the logic.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.300
So if there is
already a user, then

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.820
let's display the
log out button.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.260
And if there is
not a user, we'll

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.950
display the log in button.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:30.600
Right.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.350
Cool, so far so good.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.070
Let's also add a
little bit of script

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.050
here to define our element.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.540
So I will say this element
is a my-login element.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.550
And for the properties,
we basically

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.900
will want to expose
this user property.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.030
So it's a user.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.200
Which is an object.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.450
We also want to have that
status known property.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.650
So status known.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.780
And that is also
going to be an object.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.610
OK.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.000
And now I want to implement
these log in and log out

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.610
methods.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.480
So these should be
pretty straightforward.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.010
We're basically just going
to use some of the APIs

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.360
that the Firebase Auth
element expose's for us.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.830
So I'm going to just go ahead
and paste some code in here

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.270
that I already copied.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.770
And what we're going
to do, is we're

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.140
going to use the ID
of the auth element.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.059
So remember, when
we say this .$,

00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:27.600
that's Polymer's way of saying
reference this thing with this

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.730
ID.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.790
So we'll say this .$.auth,
sign in with pop up.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.100
And that method basically
tells the auth element

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.140
to open the o-auth
screen and ask someone

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.210
to sign in using Google.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.000
For the log out method, it's
basically just call sign

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.770
out using that.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.327
The last thing
that I want to do,

00:12:45.327 --> 00:12:47.160
is I want to add just
a little template here

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.360
that will toggle on and off
when we have a user or not.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.040
And it will display
that user's name.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.290
Just so we can verify that
the user object we get back

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.360
is correct.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:03.240
So I've got some code that I'm
just going to paste in here.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.790
And yeah, so I'm using a dom-if.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.040
I'm checking if we
have a user already.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.660
And then I've just got an h1.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.740
Where I'm just going to bind
to the user's display name.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.260
All right.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.770
So I think we're pretty
close to having everything

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.520
where we want it.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.519
Let's just double check
all of our imports here.

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:21.450
We don't want to have a
white screen of death.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.160
That does happen
from time to time.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.080
So everything in
my-login looks good.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.580
In my-app we need to make sure
that we are importing my-login.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.010
So let's do that.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.190
Go back up here.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.870
So we will pull
in my-login.html.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.520
We are also going
to want to pull

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.920
in that firebase-app element.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.420
So polymerfire.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.920
Firebase-app.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.030
All right.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.710
And then in our
index file, we are

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.240
pulling in the my-app element.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.440
So my-app contains
firebase-app and log in.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.185
And then log in
contains firebase-auth.

00:13:58.185 --> 00:14:00.810
Let's cross our fingers and see
if this works on the first try.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:05.160
We will run the provided
Firebase server.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.730
I know sometimes we use
Polymer CLI to serve things.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.580
But right now I'm just doing
everything with the provided

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.349
Firebase tools.

00:14:12.349 --> 00:14:14.640
We're following their project
structure and everything.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.930
In a later episode,
I'll actually

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.210
show how to integrate both
Polymer tools and Firebase

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:18.952
tools.

00:14:18.952 --> 00:14:20.910
But for now let's just
use the Firebase server.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:25.200
And it will tell us that the
app is that localhost:5000.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.340
So copy that.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.580
Drop that in here
to the Chrome's.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.510
I see I have a sign
in button there.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.590
Let's zoom in a little
bit so you can see that.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:39.410
Clicking on that should
give me an o-auth pop up.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.486
And ask me to sign in.

00:14:41.486 --> 00:14:43.410
And I sign in.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.810
And then boom, it says,
welcome Rob Dodson.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.240
Lets me know that we
have a user object.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.930
And if I want, I
can then sign out.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.354
And start the process
all over again.

00:14:53.354 --> 00:14:54.770
So that about
covers it for today.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.570
We've now got kind of
the basics of setting up

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.960
Firebase and setting up Firebase
authentication in our project.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.150
There's still a lot
more to talk about,

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.214
but I'm going to save
that for the next episode.

00:15:05.214 --> 00:15:06.880
So if you have any
questions, as always,

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.790
you can leave them for me
down below in the comments.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.164
Or you can hit me up on a
social network of your choosing

00:15:11.164 --> 00:15:12.735
at #askpolymer.

00:15:12.735 --> 00:15:14.360

much for watching,

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.564
and I'll see you next time.

00:15:16.564 --> 00:15:17.980
