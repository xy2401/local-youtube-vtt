[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:05.500
Hey there, Polycasters.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.120
Rob, here.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.830
Today on the show we're going to
be continuing our series on Web

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.870
Component Tester by
looking at Travis

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.180
CI, and continuous
integration with Sauce Labs.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.400
A lot of fancy buzz words
there, but basically,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.540
what I'm describing
is testing your site

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.770
on multiple browsers
in the cloud.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.110
So, to do that, first thing
that we're going to do

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.300
is set up Travis CI.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.690
Now, if you've never
heard of Travis CI before,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.649
you may have actually
seen it and not known it.

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.106
Oftentimes, you go
to GitHub repos,

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:32.770
and they have these
little green badges

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.370
that say "bill passing,"
that's Travis CI.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.260
It's a little service that
lets you run unit tests up

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.530
in the cloud.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.450
Now, one of the cool
things about Travis

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.520
is that it can sort of
work with other services,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.020
and one of those services that
we're going to couple it with

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.810
is called Sauce Labs.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.090
Now, Sauce Labs'
whole thing is letting

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.620
you run your test
against multiple browsers

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.870
on different VMs.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.480
So, imagine being able to test
Windows, Internet Explorer

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.260
10, and also iOS, and
also old Android browser,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.620
all using the same service.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.995
That's what Sauce
Labs gives you.

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:07.495
So, today, we're going to be
kind of combining both of those

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:09.260
to verify that our
components work really

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.547
well on different platforms.

00:01:10.547 --> 00:01:12.130
Now, the first thing
we're going to do

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.460
is set up our Travis account.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.769
So, here, I've already
gone and registered

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:17.810
and everything like that.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.680
And what I want to
do is go over to up

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.406
on the top right,
where it says Accounts.

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:23.530
Click on that, that'll take
you to this page, here.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.500
And there's some
steps that it outlines

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.650
for setting up your account
to work with Travis.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.470
The first is going and finding
your repo in there, and just,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.750
like, flipping that little
switch to enable your repo.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.250
Then, you're going
to need to set up

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.640
a little travis.yml
configuration file.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.140
And that's basically just to
give Travis instructions, like,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.750
hey, what do I do when
you push new code, right?

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.130
The last thing
you're going to do

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.570
is just trigger a bill by
doing a regular old git push.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.450
So, for these tests, we're going
to be using a set of elements

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.700
that I've already created,
called chart elements.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.960
So, let's go find
those in the list.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.645
[MOUTH NOUSE]

00:01:58.645 --> 00:01:59.270
There they are.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.090
We're going to flip
this switch right here.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.540
And that is basically it.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.930
Now we've linked Travis
to this GitHub repo.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.620
So when I'm pushing
new code, it's

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.699
going to-- if there's a
configuration file-- tell

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.280
Travis to do a
bunch of cool stuff.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.613
And the next thing I want to
do is go over to Sauce Labs

00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:15.290
and create my Sauce account.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.120
Saucy.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.631
Sauce has a section on their
website called Open Sauce.

00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:21.880
And basically, what they do
is they give free accounts

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.713
to folks who are doing
open source software,

00:02:23.713 --> 00:02:25.614
which is maybe
you, in this case.

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:27.780
I'll include a link to this
down in the description,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.446
so you don't have to
hunt around for it.

00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:32.590
You go to that page, and if
you scroll down to the bottom

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.300
there, you're going
to see a little button

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.397
for creating your account.

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:36.980
Click on that.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.550
It'll take you through a pretty
typical flow for setting up

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.480
your own Sauce account.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.490
And once you're done, it's going
to take you to a dashboard that

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.900
looks kind of like this.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.570
Now, the really important
thing in this dashboard,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.944
is down there in
the bottom left,

00:02:48.944 --> 00:02:51.155
you've got this little
access key, right?

00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:53.030
So, I'm going to blur
that out in this video,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.020
so you can't see mine, but
yours will not be blurred.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.044
Get that access key, save
it to your clipboard,

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.960
because we're going to
use that in just a sec.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.334
The next thing
that we want to do

00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:03.450
is figure out what browsers
do we want to test.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.950
So.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.658
If we go to the Sauce
Labs wiki, and I'll

00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:08.000
include a link to that in
the description as well.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.861
You can see that there's a whole
host of different browsers,

00:03:10.861 --> 00:03:12.860
different version numbers,
different platforms--

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.700
right-- all of these are
available for us to test upon.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.120
So, we could test Android, we
could test Chrome or Firefox,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.590
we could test on
Windows or Vista or Mac

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.590
or what have you, right?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.500
All these are available.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.124
So I'm just going to go through
and kind of pick a few of these

00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:28.240
that we can use in
our application.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.370
Next, we'll go to the Web
Component Tester website,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.390
and we'll look at the
Read Me file, which has

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.840
a little section on plugins.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.990
Now, Web Component Tester
ships with a Sauce Labs plugin,

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.945
so we can just copy this little
block of JavaScript right here,

00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:45.770
go over to our text
editor, paste that

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:53.240
in, in a web components conf
JSON file, so wct.conf.Json,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.500
right.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.080
So, we're going to do plugins,
Sauce browsers, and inside

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.334
of browsers, I'm just
going to go ahead and chuck

00:04:00.334 --> 00:04:01.750
in a whole bunch
of these browsers

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.940
that I grab from
the Sauce Labs wiki.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.032
So, I've got Microsoft
Edge on Windows 10--

00:04:06.032 --> 00:04:08.240
there's no version number
because that's an evergreen

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.800
browser-- but just
below that, we've

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.385
got Internet Explorer running
version 11 on Windows 8.1.

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:15.410
And it's really awesome
that you have just all

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.500
of these different
platforms available to you.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.089
If you're a Windows user, maybe
don't have access to a Mac,

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.500
then we can test on Safari on
different versions of OS X,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.781
right, very cool stuff there.

00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:27.280
Once I've got that
squared away, I'm

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.980
going to go back to
the Polymer/tools repo.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.851
Inside of here, there's
a sample Travis file

00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:34.350
and a bunch of steps
that'll outline

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.190
how we get things working
with Travis and Sauce Labs.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.720
So, going down here, there's
a list of the different Travis

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.850
commands that you can do.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.558
We've actually done
all of these already,

00:04:44.558 --> 00:04:46.750
but you have them here
again for reference.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.320
And then we're going to go down
to the section that says Web

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.870
Component Tester with Sauce.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.570
Right?

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.340
So, there's a few items
here that we need to tackle.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.820
The first is, we need to
grab this sample Travis file.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.560
And then, we're going to need
to install the Travis Ruby gem.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.120
And lastly, we're going to
run these two commands here

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.230
to encrypt our Sauce Labs info.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.580
So, we're going to go grab this
Travis file, Travis with Sauce,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.760
and-- I'm just going
to go to raw mode,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.750
hit enhance, enhance,
enhance-- OK.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.030
And now it is nice
and ginormous.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.045
I'll paste that
into my text editor.

00:05:19.045 --> 00:05:19.544
Mmm.

00:05:19.544 --> 00:05:20.430
Boop.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.180
Now, this is a lot of codes.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.055
What's going on here?

00:05:24.055 --> 00:05:25.721
Let's walk through
these piece by piece.

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:27.630
Up at the top, the first
thing that I'm doing

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.345
is, I'm just telling Travis
what environment to run in.

00:05:30.345 --> 00:05:32.470
Travis can run all sorts
of different environments.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.650
Here, I'm just saying I
want it to be node js.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.880
I want it to run the most
stable version of node.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.790
And I don't want it to call
sudo or do anything like that.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.740
Next, I'm telling
Travis what browsers

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.030
I want it to install locally.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.880
Now, you don't have to do this
part-- this part is optional--

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.240
but I just thought it would
be kind of a cool thing

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.110
to include.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.754
Travis itself has access
to a couple browsers,

00:05:52.754 --> 00:05:55.170
if you want to try and test,
like, Firefox or Chrome, just

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.240
there locally.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.120
So, I'm actually putting
in these commands.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.144
This will install those on
Travis, so we have them.

00:06:01.144 --> 00:06:03.060
And then below that,
there's this little block

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.210
called before_scripts.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.410
So, this is all the
codes that's going to run

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.244
before I kick off my test.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.160
And this is-- basically,
it's all the preamble

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.500
to set up and prep the VM.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.660
So, I'm installing
Web Component Tester.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.200
I'm installing bower.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.490
I'm exporting the path to
the node modules binaries

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.150
for Web Component Tester.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.960
And I'm also going
and calling bower

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.016
install to install
all of my components.

00:06:27.016 --> 00:06:28.640
So, that is going to
set everything up.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.159
Now the environment is primed.

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:31.700
The last thing that
we're going to do

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.290
is call these two
scripts down here.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.760
And you might be
looking at these,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.450
being like, whoa, I have no
idea what any of that does.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.290
Let me decipher it a little bit.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.200
That first line that says
xvfb-run wct, that basically

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.560
says, hey, on Travis,
just here locally,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.120
I want to run Web
Component Tester,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.578
and that's actually going to
test those two browsers that I

00:06:53.578 --> 00:06:56.060
installed: local Firefox
and local Chrome.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.700
The line after that is
going to check to see

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.410
if this was a pull request.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.460
If it was not, if we just,
like, pushed some code to GitHub

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.950
or something like
that, then it's

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.950
going to run our
test in Sauce Labs,

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.770
using that whole
huge list of browsers

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.540
that I wrote out before.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.754
Now, to make this work
exactly as we specced it out,

00:07:13.754 --> 00:07:16.170
I'm going to need to add a
couple flags to these commands.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.230
This first line here, I'm going
to add the skip-plugin sauce

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.200
command, and the
second line below, I'll

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.730
add the skip-plugin
local command.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.580
Basically, what that means is,
when we're testing in Travis,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.500
we only want to use
the local browsers.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.000
When we're testing
in Sauce Labs,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.260
we only want to use that list of
browsers that we defined there.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.767
Everything is square, let's now
go and set up our Sauce keys,

00:07:36.767 --> 00:07:39.350
and this is going to lead us to,
sort of, secure communication

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.440
back and forth between
Travis and Sauce Labs.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.250
I've already gone ahead and
installed the Travis gem,

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.810
and if you have not done that,
you can run gem install Travis.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.840
And then call travis encrypt.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.640
You're passing your Sauce
user name and the add flag,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.860
and then travis encrypt,
passing your Sauce access key

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.031
and do the add flag
there, as well.

00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:00.530
And that's going to write all
those values to your YML file.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.946
You can actually go back and
verify that you've got these,

00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:05.910
like, big secure
blocks of hashes.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.610
This means you're
square, you're set up,

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.730
and now you can actually start
working with Travis and Sauce.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.740
Go back to our
terminal, and we're

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.860
going to run git add, git
commit, and, lastly, git push.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.500
We're just going to-- pew--
send all that code up there,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.620
and then we can
switch over to Travis,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.260
and we can actually watch all
of our tests running against all

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.510
these different browsers live.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.750
So, you can just sit there
and watch the output,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.346
as it runs Chrome 47, Firefox,
et cetera, right-- those

00:08:31.346 --> 00:08:34.330
are those local browsers
that Travis already has.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.820
And then if we let
it keep running,

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.750
now we'll start to
see Windows 10, OS X,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.700
this is now it
talking to Sauce Labs,

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.960
kicking off all these other
browsers in the cloud.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.501
And you can see that
all of our tests

00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:45.765
are passing there, as well.

00:08:45.765 --> 00:08:46.630
Saucy.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.750
That is the basics of
setting up Travis and Sauce.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.897
It is a great approach
to take, if you

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:54.480
want to go ahead and figure out
if your components are working

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.207
well in a cross-browser fashion.

00:08:56.207 --> 00:08:58.540
There's a lot more that I
want to cover on these topics,

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.560
so if there's things
that maybe you're

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.190
