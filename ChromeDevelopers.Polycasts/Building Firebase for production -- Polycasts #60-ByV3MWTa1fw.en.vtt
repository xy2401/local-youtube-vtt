ROB DODSON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.340
What's up?

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.180
It's Rob Dodson.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.560
Welcome back to Polycast.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.030
So today on the
show, we're going

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.569
to be wrapping up our tour
of Polymer and Firebase

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:14.610
by taking this project
that we've been working on

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.520
and integrating it with
the polymer-build library

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.310
so that we can build
it for production.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.380
So follow me over
here to my laptop.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.050
And we're picking up where
we left off last time.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.950
So we've got this
project that we created.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.449
We can go ahead and maybe start
up our server so we can just

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.810
like preview this thing.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.310
OK.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.160
So when we go to
our terminal here.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.870
We can run Firebase serve.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.460
Here, I'll embiggen this
a bit so you can see it.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.325
Firebase serve.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:41.700
Then I'll start
up a local server

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.960
just so we can see
what we're working on.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.460
OK.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.750
So this is where we
left off last time.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.458
We had this kind of
like to-do list thing

00:00:47.458 --> 00:00:48.390
that we were building.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.015
It kind of looks like
a mess right now,

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.477
because we added messaging.

00:00:51.477 --> 00:00:53.310
We added a bunch of
other weird stuff to it.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.770
So the design is like
totally wacky, but whatever.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.051
It has the features that we
want for our application.

00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.550
And today, we're
just going to cover

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.940
how we bundle all the code
together so we can launch it up

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.054
onto Firebase hosting.

00:01:04.054 --> 00:01:05.970
In my project, the first
thing I'm going to do

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.690
is I'm going to create a Polymer
in JSON file, Polymer.json.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.550
And inside of this
file, we're going

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.360
to tell Polymer's build
library about the entry points

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.705
to our application, about
our application shell,

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:22.830
and about any other sort
of like extra dependencies

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.094
that we want to package
up for our build.

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:27.510
So I've gone ahead and actually
just saved this puppy out,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.610
and I'll bump this up
a little bit so you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.060
can see what we've got here.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.230
So we've got this entry point,
which is our public index HTML

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.939
file that just tells
polymer-build, hey,

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.730
this is where we're
going to start our app.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.771
And then we've got our
shell, which if you recall

00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:40.800
is our my-app element.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.758
So everything that we've
been working on so far

00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:45.360
has been kind of
contained within my-app.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.940
Now, if you are using
something like the PRPL pattern

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.530
and you had
additional fragments,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.409
you could add to this
Polymer JSON as well.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.950
So those would be
views that you were

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.720
like lazy-loading over time.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.330
In our case, inside
of my-app, we've

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.826
actually just got
all of our views

00:01:58.826 --> 00:01:59.950
just displaying right here.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.310
So we've got my log in,
my notes, my subscription,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.160
et cetera.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.660
So we don't have any fragments
or anything like that.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.880
We're just going to
tell it about my-app,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.850
and it'll bundle that up.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.558
And then the last
field that we have here

00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:10.300
is our extra dependencies.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.940
So these are things
which we're not

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.060
referencing as HTML imports,
so Polymer itself is not

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.239
referencing these things.

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.030
But these are files
that we do know that we

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.410
need to include in our build.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.280
We want to make sure
they get copied over.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.721
So this is things like
our manifest.json,

00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:26.220
the Firebase Messaging service
worker, which we talked about

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.380
in our last episode, and our
webcomponents-lite polyfills.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.950
So we're going to tell it
to copy these over as well.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.640
So that will instruct
the polymer-build library

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.464
what to copy.

00:02:36.464 --> 00:02:38.880
The next thing we want to do
is create a package JSON file

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.130
and actually install a
polymer-build itself.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.280
So make a package.json and we'll
just pop some stuff in here.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.005
So I just called it
my-project for now.

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:50.880
You can name it after
whatever you want, give

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.440
it whatever version you want.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.200
We're going to include a
little NPM build step here.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.450
So I'm just going to
include a build step that's

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.080
going to run gulp for us.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.050
And we'll get to
that in just a bit.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.591
The main thing we
care about, though,

00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:04.930
are these devDependencies
down here at the bottom.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.570
So a few items that
we're going to pull

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.680
in, we're going to
pull in this library

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.050
called del, which will allow
us to sort of like clean up our

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.030
build directory every time
we're about to do a new build.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.860
We'll pull in gulp,
and notice that we're

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.860
using version 4 here.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.980
And then these last two,
merge-stream and plylog,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.050
these are just for
debugging polymer-build

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.150
as you're using it.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.050
Or merge-stream is for
merging your streams.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.760
Plylog is for debugging.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.280
And polymer-build, we're going
to pull in the latest alpha

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.357
version, which is 0.6.0-alpha.

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:34.440
Probably by the time you're
watching this episode,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.780
0.6 will be out already.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.430
But I wanted to go
ahead and use it now

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.710
because it's a little bit easier
to use than previous versions

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.610
of polymer-build.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.609
So we've got that ready.

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.737
We're going to run NPM install.

00:03:44.737 --> 00:03:47.070
And I've actually already got
all these things installed

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.528
in my node module,
so we don't have

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.460
to wait for it to
download or anything.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.520
The next thing we want to
do is create a gulpfile.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.680
So we make gulpfile.js.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.420
And what I'm going
to be doing here

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.240
is I'm going to be using gulp
and the polymer-build library

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.690
directly instead of
using polymer-cli itself.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.810
Now, if we used
polymer-cli on this project

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.560
and we just ran
polymer-build, it actually

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.790
would do a pretty good job
of building everything,

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.790
but it's going to create
some additional things,

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.890
like a service worker, and
it's going to kind of put it

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.681
in sort of a weird
place, because right now

00:04:15.681 --> 00:04:18.870
polymer-build-- the CLI service
worker's not programmable

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.050
for the output directory.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.600
That's something that they're
going to probably change

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.891
in a future version of the CLI.

00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:25.230
So we don't have these like
weird vestigial files laying

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.350
around and stuff
like that, we're just

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.645
going to use
polymer-build directly,

00:04:27.645 --> 00:04:29.395
and we're going to
tell it exactly what we

00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:30.220
want it to build.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.303
So we're going to do that
inside of this gulpfile.

00:04:32.303 --> 00:04:35.210
And I've actually gone ahead
and pre-written this gulpfile,

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.230
because there's a fair
bit of code in here.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.210
We can walk through
these piece-by-piece

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.060
just so you sort
of like understand

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.660
what is going on here.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.760
At the top of our
gulpfile, we're

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.670
just pulling in a
few items that we'll

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.400
need for doing work like
setting up our paths,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.260
pulling gulp,
merging our streams,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.094
deleting files, and
things like that.

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:56.010
This is all sort of like
typical boiler plate.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.885
Where it gets interesting
is when we get down

00:04:57.885 --> 00:04:59.170
here to like polymer.json.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.462
So we're actually going
to require polymer.json.

00:05:02.462 --> 00:05:04.295
We're going to pull in
our polymer.json file

00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:06.949
so that we have it in gulp.

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:08.990
We're going to pull in
the polymer-build library,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.990
and we're going to pass
it our polymer.json file

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.980
when we instantiate it.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.255
So that way, it has
some configuration.

00:05:14.255 --> 00:05:15.470
And then we're going
to tell it that we

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.636
want our build directory
where it outputs everything

00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:18.970
to be build/bundled.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.720
So this is going to
take everything that's

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.220
in our public
directory right now

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.678
and put it in
build/bundled/public.

00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:24.245
Flash

00:05:24.245 --> 00:05:26.120
Then I have to find this
littler helper here,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.250
because the gulpfile that
we're going to create

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.230
is going to be maybe a little
atypical from most gulpfiles

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.040
that you've seen.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.960
It's going to be basically
one build function that's

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.570
going to have a promise
chain, and there's

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.360
going to be a few
places where we're

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.401
going to wait on some
streams from polymer-build.

00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:40.250
So we've got this waitfor
function right here.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.690
All this does is it
returns a promise

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.130
and it listens for a
stream's end or error event

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.990
and either resolves or
rejects the promise.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.700
This is going to be very
helpful for our build function.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.670
And then inside of the
build function itself,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.560
we're going to kick
off polymer-build.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.280
Now, the polymer-build library,
if you recall from our episode

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.300
on writing your own generator
using the polymer-build library

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.770
and the custom
generator init function,

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.647
polymer-build library takes
all of your HTML imports,

00:06:07.647 --> 00:06:09.980
it looks at the CSS in them,
it looks at the JS in them,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.830
it looks at the HTML and
it extracts each of those

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.780
into its own file stream.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.310
And you can run transformations
on those streams.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.040
So if you want to
do CSS modification,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.560
you want to do JavaScript
uglifying or something

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.809
like that, you can after it
has split apart those streams.

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:26.600
And then once you've
done those transforms,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.851
it rejoins everything for you.

00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:29.266
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:06:29.266 --> 00:06:31.340
going to start off by
calling this del function.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.810
We're going to delete
the build directory.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.560
If there's already
something inside of it,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.620
we'll just clean it out
so we can start fresh.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.090
And then we're just going to
work through a little promise

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.630
chain.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.540
So we're going to create
a source stream using

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.230
the polymer-build library.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.060
What it's going to
do is it's going

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.018
to look at our entry
point for our application.

00:06:46.018 --> 00:06:48.110
It's going to look at
that my-app HTML file,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.330
and it's going to figure
out all the HTML imports

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.770
that it references and it will
treat all of those as sources.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.490
So I'm going to create
a stream for that.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.560
We're going to tell
it to split the HTML.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.890
That's how we create the CSS,
the JS, and the HTML streams.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.540
And here is where
you can run any sort

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.900
of transforms you want to do.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.680
So for instance, if you were
using something like Uglify,

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.136
you could then pipe one of
those streams to Uglify.

00:07:10.136 --> 00:07:11.510
You would use the
gulp-if library

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.710
to check the file extension.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.230
So if it's a JavaScript
file, pipe it to Uglify.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.800
If it's a CSS file,
pipe it to css-slam.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.475
HTML pipes to
html-minifier, et cetera.

00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:22.850
So I'm going to
comment these out

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.830
for now, because I don't have
these libraries installed just

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.070
yet.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.486
But I'm going to
leave these here,

00:07:26.486 --> 00:07:28.130
and when I put the
code up on GitHub,

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.254
these will be here for you.

00:07:29.254 --> 00:07:31.850
So if you want to add your
own gulp transforms, you can.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.680
So that'll be all
of our source files.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.420
And then we've also
got a separate step

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.449
where we work through
all of our dependencies.

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:39.740
So this is stuff that's living
in like bower_components

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.790
or whatever.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.610
If you want to uglify
those or css-slam those,

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.694
you can as well.

00:07:44.694 --> 00:07:46.610
So that's going to create
two streams, sources

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.530
and dependencies.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.810
And then we're just going to
merge the two streams together.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.976
We'll have a little
console log here as soon

00:07:52.976 --> 00:07:54.350
as we start getting
some data out

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.183
of the stream that just
tells the user, hey,

00:07:56.183 --> 00:07:57.800
we're analyzing these streams.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.410
If we want to do
bundling, we can pass it

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.999
to our Polymer Project Bundler.

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:04.540
So we're going to pipe all those
streams into Polymer Project

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.030
Bundler.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.440
That's what's going to
go through and basically

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.080
run vulcanize on your behalf
and start to put everything

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.545
into the my-app file.

00:08:10.545 --> 00:08:12.170
You can do additional
things here, too,

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.660
like if you wanted add prefetch
links and stuff like that,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.090
you could explore doing that
with your own transforms.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.048
And lastly, we're just
going to take everything

00:08:19.048 --> 00:08:21.230
and we're going to pipe
it to the build directory,

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.467
which if you remember
is build/bundled.

00:08:23.467 --> 00:08:25.050
We set that up at
the top of the file.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.100
And then we're just going to
use this waitfor helper function

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.340
to wait on the build stream.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.910
So after it's done
processing all of our files,

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.086
this promise will resolve.

00:08:34.086 --> 00:08:36.710
And we can move down to the very
last step in the promise chain

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.418
where we're just going
to console log out

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:40.400
to the user, hey,
everything is done.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.100
We'll resolve that
one last promise,

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.690
and then that's it
for our gulp task.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.810
That's our entire build
process for our Polymer site.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.490
The last thing to do
is just to set this

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.190
as our default
build step for gulp,

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.450
and we should be
off to the races.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.600
So let's open our sidebar here.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.780
And let's give it a shot.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.330
So we'll open our
terminal up, and we

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.820
will run-- I've got to make this
a little bit bigger-- so we're

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.620
going to run gulp.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.230
Or because I added in
my package.json file,

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.340
I added a build script, we
could also run npm run build.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.200
Either one of those should work.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.950
So we run that, and
we should start seeing

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.330
those console logs coming out.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.590
So it's deleting
the build directory.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.173
It's analyzing our
build dependencies.

00:09:17.173 --> 00:09:18.980
Then it tells us the
build is complete.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.852
We go back to our text editor.

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:22.310
And we look at our
build directory.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.560
You can see now we've got--
inside of build/bundled,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.770
we've got all of
our project files.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.830
It copied over things like
our Firebase Messaging service

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.387
worker, because we added
that to extra dependencies.

00:09:33.387 --> 00:09:35.720
And if you look at my-app.html,
you can see that it sort

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.820
of munged all the
code into this file.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.200
So it ran vulcanize
for us, which is great.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.170
The last thing we can
do is we can preview

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.121
this using the Firebase server.

00:09:44.121 --> 00:09:45.620
The one change we
need to make there

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.414
is we'll go to firebase.json.

00:09:47.414 --> 00:09:48.830
For hosting, we'll
tell it that we

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.130
want to look at
build/bundled/public.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.190
Save that.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.980
Go over to our terminal.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.710
So we'll run firebase
serve, and it'll

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.770
tell us that it's serving
build/bundled/public.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.024
Click on localhost5000.

00:10:03.024 --> 00:10:03.690
And here you go.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.614
Here is our bundled project.

00:10:05.614 --> 00:10:08.030
And we can verify that it's
the bundled version by opening

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.872
our network panel, clearing
everything out, hard

00:10:10.872 --> 00:10:12.330
refreshing the
page, and you'll see

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.240
that instead of requesting like
tons and tons of HTML imports

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.700
for all of our dependencies,
we only really see

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.870
a couple of HTML imports.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.070
I think we actually only
see my-app.html Looking

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.070
at the source for that,
we can verify that it is

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.150
the vulcanized version.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.316
So at that point, the only
thing you have left to do

00:10:26.316 --> 00:10:28.095
is to run Firebase
deploy and your site

00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:29.970
is ready to share with
the rest of the world.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.480
So that about
covers it for today.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.690
