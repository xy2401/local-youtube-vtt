ELLIOTT MARQUEZ: : Hey there,
Polycasters, I'm Elliott.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.271
Welcome back to our series
on building an element

00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:09.440
in Polymer 2.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.840
In the last video, we got to
know the layout of a Polymer

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.770
element.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.380
Now let's get to work
building a simple checklist.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.330
We'll start by mocking it up.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.130
So a checklist is going to
have some simple checkboxes

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.250
and a input.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.440
So let's create a checkbox.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.770
So input of type Checkbox.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.270
Let's remove these other things.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.157
We don't need that right there.

00:00:35.157 --> 00:00:36.740
And then we'll create
an normal input.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.670
And so if we go over here,
this looks about right.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.250
You have a checkbox and you
have the name of your tasks,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.890
like getTomatoes.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.250
But the thing is, a checkbox
usually has more than just

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.750
this.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.330
So we might want to have
more than just that.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.540
Let's copy-paste this
a bunch of times.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.740
And here's a bunch of
different checkboxes.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.760
And let's see what
else we can do.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.290
Let's add a header
for the title.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.930
Let's say this is
the To-Do section

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.390
and we'll also
create a Completed

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.920
section so you know exactly
what you've done already.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.950
And we'll call this
Completed and we'll

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.170
copy-paste a few here.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.920
And we'll add a button at the
bottom to create a bit more.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.216
So Add Task.

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:37.480
Give it a refresh.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.600
Looks pretty good.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.230
We have a To-Do section
with a bunch of things

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.450
that you want to do and then
you have Completed section.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.260
And these should all
be checked at the end.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.780
And an Add Task button, which
would create more tasks.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.280
All right.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.450
And so let's go back.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.070
Let's clean it up just a bit.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.000
Let's remove this section and
we'll put a placeholder here

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.060
so we remember to go back here.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.360
Add completed stuff.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.790
And then let's take a
look at the To-Do section.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.070
So the To-Do
section's a bit long.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.370
It's something that we
can't really scale up,

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.690
so if somebody wants
100 different things,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.260
you're going to have to
copy-paste this 100 times,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.090
and that's not
exactly what we want.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.890
It'd be nice to consolidate
and have one section that

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.195
repeats dynamically.

00:02:22.195 --> 00:02:26.230
Luckily, the Polymer library
has a very nice feature in it

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.610
called Dom Repeat.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.720
You can find this and other
types of useful libraries

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.800
in the Lib folder inside
of the Polymer Directory.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.510
In here, you'll see things like
elements and utilities, mixins

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.400
and some Legacy
stuff from Polymer 1

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.150
if you're still
attached to that.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.400
And so here you'll
see DomRepeat.html.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.717
Let's import that.

00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:51.300
So we'll go into the
Polymer Directory

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.660
and import the Lib
Directory and then Elements

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.682
and then Dom Repeat.

00:02:58.682 --> 00:02:59.746
Ta-da.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.100
There it is.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.700
Let's type it in here.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.910
And so Dom Repeat is
an element that wraps

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.750
around your repeating sections.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.280
So we'll create that.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.020
Move this.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.520
Cut it up.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.686
Create a template tag
and paste it in there.

00:03:20.686 --> 00:03:21.400
All right.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.460
Now let's just fix this up
and make it look all pretty.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.370
Cool.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.240
Nice.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.010
So let's go repeat.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.510
Nothing's repeating.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.320
What did we do wrong?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.570
So luckily, the Polymer
IDE, when you mouse over it,

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.040
will tell you a lot of nice
features about this element.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.090
So here, it's actually
a slightly older version

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.435
of Dom Repeat, so it
takes an items property

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:51.170
and it has a template
with the things

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.150
that you actually
want to repeat.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.550
So let's go type that in.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.200
So in Dom Repeat,
let's type in Items.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.180
Here, the Polymer IDE
again will tell you

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.690
a bunch of different things,
like items only takes an array

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.640
and it determines
how many instances

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.510
you'll have of the template.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.570
So let's data bind
this over to a variable

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.190
that we're going to call Tasks.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.640
And so Tasks, we're going
to have to define over here

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.460
in the Properties block.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.900
So we have Tasks.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.689
We're going to call the type
Array and then call the value.

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.480
We're going to make it
a function that just

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.180
simply returns an empty array.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.880
Let's refresh.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.089
Still nothing because
the array's empty.

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:43.380
So let's fill it up with stuff.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.050
So we'll have one,
two, three, four, five.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.885
Sorry it's not zero indexed.

00:04:48.885 --> 00:04:50.020
And ta-da.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.520
Here you go.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.600
You have five different
things repeated.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.800
You can also do nice things,
like rename the property

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.330
with as, and so we'll say
these items that are passed in,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.990
we're going to call
them the variable task.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.410
And in here, in the text
input, we'll bind it to that.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:22.330
So we'll have input type
text with the value of task.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.490
Go back over here
and there you go.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.410
It data binds the values
that were in the array.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.130
So we've mocked up
a simple checklist

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.610
but there's still some
work that we can do

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.975
to make it look a little nicer.

00:05:31.975 --> 00:05:35.110
In the next video, we'll use
pre-made elements and styling

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.200
to clean things up.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.160
See you soon.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.510
