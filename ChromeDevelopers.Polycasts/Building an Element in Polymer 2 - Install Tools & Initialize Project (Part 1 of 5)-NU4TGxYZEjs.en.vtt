00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:05.270
ELLIOTT MARQUEZ: Hey
there, Polycasters.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.080
I'm Elliott.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.710
And in this short
series of videos,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.085
we're going to set up our
Polymer environment for Polymer

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:12.920
projects, and then we're going
to create a Polymer 2 element.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.690
Let's get started with
installing the proper tools.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.620
So first we're going
to install Node.js.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.750
My favorite way
to install Node.js

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.760
is using the Nod
Version Manager, or NVM.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.550
You can easily find this by
just Googling it for "NVM."

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.430
And you'll see this GitHub
thing for creationix.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.610
At the top you'll
have a quick install

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.650
scripts where you
can just copy/paste

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.220
if you have a Bash prompt.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.360
So here's my terminal.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.490
Going to paste it right in.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.195
And it'll install.

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:48.470
All right, and once you
have that installed, NVM,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.650
you can install Node
using nvm install node.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.052
And you want to install
the stable version.

00:00:56.052 --> 00:00:56.760
And there you go.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.970
It should be set up.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.000
You'll also see this
last command out of NVM

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.550
that you want to either
run every time you start

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.630
a new terminal or put it into
your Bash profile, or your Bash

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.070
RC if you're on Ubuntu.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.790
So I'm on a Mac, so I'm going
to put this in my Bash profile.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.500
So I'm going to open up Vim and
put it into my Bash profile.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.460
And you can see I
already have it here.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.520
But let's pretend
I don't have that.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.190
And you would just
paste it in, save it.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.050
And you can restart
your terminal.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.080
But I already have that, so I'm
not going to restart for now.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.652
Let me just clear this up.

00:01:32.652 --> 00:01:34.110
Now that we have
Node installed, we

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.710
want to install the Polymer CLI.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.560
The Polymer CLI is a tool
created by the Polymer team.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.200
And it allows you to
initialize projects,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.780
and it has a lot of really
nice features to it.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.310
We'll go through them
one at a time later.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.490
So npm install.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.970
And we want to
install it globally,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.060
so we're going to
use the dash g flag.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.990
And we're going to install
the Polymer dash CLI,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.950
have that run.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.596
This might take a
few minutes depending

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:00.220
on how fast your
internet connection is

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.820
and how fast your machine is.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.070
All right, now that we have
the Polymer CLI installed,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.190
we can test it running
the polymer command.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.039
And you should see a really
nice logo right there.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.660
Next we want to
install Bower, which

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.370
is a package manager
that we typically

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.380
use with Polymer projects.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.110
So we're going to npm install.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.120
We're going to install it
globally using the dash g flag.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.732
And it's just simply bower.

00:02:21.732 --> 00:02:23.190
We're going to
speed everything up,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.340
but this should actually
take a few minutes.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.950
So now we have all the command
line interfaces installed.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.240
Now let's get started with
our IDE and text editors.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.760
So you can use,
typically, almost any IDE

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.560
to develop with Polymer.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.100
I personally like VS Code.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.320
And in VS Code, they
have a nice part

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.820
where they have extensions.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.450
In here you can search
for "Polymer IDE."

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.990
And it's typically the first
one by the Polymer team.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.640
Hit Install, and then
reload your project.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.300
All right, now we're all set up.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.370
Let's initialize a project.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.095
So here I'm going to go to my
desktop, cd to the desktop.

00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:03.310
Then I'm going to
make a directory.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.722
And we're going to call
it "Polycast checklist."

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.020
Now let's cd into that.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.620
And now just double-check
we're in there.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.740
And now let's
initialize our project.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.620
So polymer init is the command
to initialize your project.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.550
Just hit Enter there.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.740
You'll get a bunch
of options to create

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.470
a Polymer 2 element, an
application starter kit,

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.610
et cetera.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.392
We'll go with an
element for now.

00:03:31.392 --> 00:03:33.600
The element name is going
to be "Polycast checklist,"

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.720
so you can just skip
through this and hit Enter.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.180
For now we'll skip
the description.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.730
And it's going to bower
install all the dependencies.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.280
Cool, looks like we're set up.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.650
Now, one last thing-- polymer
serve will start up a server

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.520
and actually show what
you have running so far.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.370
So here we want to
copy the second one,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.980
because we're creating an
element or reusable component.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.120
So copy that, go over to
my browser, paste it in.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.520
And ta-da, we're running.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.170
So that's it.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.940
We've got our tools installed
and our live environment

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.440
running.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.370
In the next video, we'll
familiarize ourselves

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.620
with our project's layout.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.430
See you soon.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.780
