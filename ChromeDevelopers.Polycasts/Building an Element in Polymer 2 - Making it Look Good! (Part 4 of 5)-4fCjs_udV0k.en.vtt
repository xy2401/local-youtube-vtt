ELLIOTT MARQUEZ: Hey there,
Polycasters, I'm Elliott.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.371
Welcome back to our series
on building an element

00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:09.590
in Polymer 2.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.070
In the last video, we mocked
up a simple checklist.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.000
Now we want to clean it up and
make it look production-ready.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.054
Luckily, the Polymer
team creates a catalog

00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:19.470
of elements called the paper
elements, which are based off

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.120
of the material design spec.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.710
Let's take a look.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.140
There's a website
called WebComponents.org

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.900
and here it has a catalog of
all types of web components

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.800
that people use.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.340
For an example, we can
look up Paper Input.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.549
All right, so here we have
the Paper Input element.

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:38.840
The Paper Input element has
a lot of nice things on it.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.570
It has a demo where you can
change a bunch of things,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.710
like here, you can change
the email over to Gmail,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.370
and you see it
changes right there.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.870
Cool.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.160
So I want to use this element.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.120
And the way you can use it is
by going to this section right

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.140
here and you'll see
a Download feature.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.080
If you click on this, it'll
copy it to your clipboard.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.500
You just go over
to your terminal.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.456
Let's create a new tab here.

00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:06.650
Just make sure we're
in the right directory.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.930
Yes, we're in the Polycast
Checklist directory,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.090
and just paste in the command.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.100
So this is going to
install the Paper Input

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.770
element as a dependency.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.750
So if you look over here,
back in the Bower Components

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.380
directory where it installs
all of our dependencies,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.440
you'll see Paper Input show up.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.210
And then again in
the Bower.JSON,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.700
which is the configuration
file for Bower,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.110
you'll see that our dependency
now includes Paper Input.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.610
All right.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.260
So now let's go use it.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.160
So Polycast Checklist.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.980
Let's go into the
Paper Input directory

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.300
and within there is
the PaperInput.html

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.790
that you can see right here.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.840
And so let's type that right in.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.940
Paper-Input.html
and it found it.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.440
I also know that
we want to replace

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.010
the button and the checkbox
and I know for a fact

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.094
that we also have Paper
Button and Paper Checkbox.

00:02:10.094 --> 00:02:13.190
So let's do the same
thing for paper checkbox.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.040
Copy that, go to the
Download over here,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.530
paste it into our terminal.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:30.870
Go back, find Paper Button,
copy this right here,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.630
go right over to your terminal,
paste it in, and install.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.130
All right.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.910
And so now let's
import the other two.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.550
We have Paper Input, then
we have Paper Checkbox,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.430
and then we have Paper Button.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.052
So here we have our checkbox.

00:02:48.052 --> 00:02:49.760
Let's replace it with
the paper checkbox.

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:53.345
Checkbox.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.570
And we don't need that anymore.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.790
And this input, let's replace
it with a paper input.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.730
And we don't need this anymore.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.391
Now let's fix the button
to a paper button.

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:12.890
Cool.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.650
All right.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.850
We got that going.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.540
Let's go refresh the
page, see what we got.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.040
Nice.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.520
Looking a little bit better.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.440
It's not really styled up
nicely but we can fix that.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.630
And here's our button down here.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.280
All right.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.050
We'll go back and
start doing styling.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.610
So here, you can just make a
style tag within the template,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.010
and here, we will add a class to
this div and call this a task.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.650
And in the style,
we'll select that task

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.720
and then we can add
styling to the task.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.720
You'll notice here that
I just called it task.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.720
This isn't something you'd
typically do in a normal HTML

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.230
or CSS project because
task is such a common name

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.910
and you can be
using it all around.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.060
And I don't know about you but
I've always had a lot of issues

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.390
where my CSS is just
coloring everything

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.060
all over the place and
restyling everything.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.340
Luckily, Polymer
uses web components.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.790
Web components have a spec
called Shadow Dom and Shadow

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.420
Dom encapsulates your
CSS only into that node.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.500
So you can call task and
you can call anything

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.920
else outside of the
element, class equals task,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.140
and it won't get
styled by this rule

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.720
that we're making right here.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.220
All right.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.100
So let's actually start styling.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.090
So here, we'll make
this a Flexbox--

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.220
display flex-- and we
will align the items.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.350
So vertically, we'll
align them straight

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.330
across through the center.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.835
And this will be center.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.890
And then let's style the
paper input onto the same line

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.830
as the checkbox, because as you
see, they're on different lines

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.450
and that doesn't
look really nice.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.366
So to do that, we can
do Display Inline Block.

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:12.060
Simple as that.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.560
All right.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.388
Let's give it a quick refresh.

00:05:15.388 --> 00:05:17.630
Ooh, something's wrong.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.130
Oh, I don't need
these right here.

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:23.260
There you go.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.629
That's a bit more centered.

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:26.170
But it still looks
a bit weird to me.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.880
Hm.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.020
Let's take a look.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.470
Let's add a label to
this Paper Input label.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.865
We'll call this Task Name
and see where that shows up.

00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:40.080
Ah, so there you go.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.070
You can see that the task
name right here is actually

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.160
causing the display jank,
where the checkbox actually

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.800
is centered but it's only
centered to the entire thing.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.220
So we can remove that
by doing no label float.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.040
So paper input has
a thing where it

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.090
allows you to remove the
label after you start typing.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.840
So we'll set that to True,
refresh, there you go.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.420
And when you backspace,
there's task name.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.320
Looks really nice.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.740
So this is looking very good.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.860
We have our repeating
elements and our To-Do section

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.210
looks almost complete.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.044
Except we can't really add
tasks to our task list.

00:06:22.044 --> 00:06:24.210
But we'll get to that in
the next video, where we'll

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.793
start adding some
logic to our element

00:06:25.793 --> 00:06:27.840
till the checklist
actually works.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.190
