00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:05.190
ELLIOTT: Hey there, Polycasters.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.135
I'm Elliott.

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:07.510
Welcome back to
our series on how

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.675
to create an element
in Polymer 2.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.050
In this video,
we're going to get

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.520
to know our project's layout.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.980
When we left off last time,
we had a live environment

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.360
of a demo running.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.430
Let's open up the project in
our editor and take a look.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.510
So you can see here, we have
the Polycast checklist/demo,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.060
and this just simply
has demo code.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.690
Let's look at the
actual project itself

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.140
and look at the
code in this demo.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.000
So going to navigate
to my desktop,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.481
open up Polycast
checklist, and here we are.

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:34.980
Setup.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.150
And in this demo, you can see
/demo, the demo directory,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.900
and in there, you'll
see index.html.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.630
Here, you'll see what
we have over here.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.130
You have Hello,
Polycast Checklist,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.150
and you simply just
have Polycast Checklist,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.854
a new element that has been
created by our project.

00:00:57.854 --> 00:01:00.020
And so here you'll see a
demo snippet and a template

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.410
and things that are inside.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.080
So now let's take a look at
the Polycast Checklist file.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.430
So this is where we
actually define our element.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.430
In here, you'll see a
bunch of different things,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.380
like HTML Import where we
import Polymer, a module,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.780
a template where we
actually display things--

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.780
so here you can
see Hello, Prop 1,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.690
and over here, you see
Hello, Polycast Checklist.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.080
This Prop 1 right here with
the double brackets around it

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.240
is what we call a
one-way data binding.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.310
A one-way data
binding, all it does

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.140
is inserts a property
into the template.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.070
And you can see here in
the Property section,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.830
we have a Prop 1 and
the default value here

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.305
is Polycast Checklist.

00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:41.930
We can change this
to whatever we want.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.420
So we can change this
to, like, Polycasters,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.735
save that, go back over
to our project, refresh.

00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:54.950
Hello, Polycasters,
how's it going?

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.040
And then you'll also see the
definition of this element.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.820
It is a class and it
extends Polymer element.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.980
And below that, you'll see
window custom elements define,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.199
then you have a bunch
of fancy stuff there.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.490
All right, let's go through
what the fancy stuff means.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.570
PolycastChecklist.is
just calls this getter

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.940
and returns Polycast
Checklist, so this is just

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.290
the same thing as saying,
define the element called

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.010
Polycast Checklist.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.860
And then you associate
it with a class, which

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.900
is this definition right here.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.088
For now, let's go back
and leave it alone.

00:02:34.088 --> 00:02:35.060
All right.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.020
Now let's look at what
else is in our directory.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.600
We have this bower.JSON,
and in here, we

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.790
have a dependency on Polymer.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.700
And you can see in the
bower components, which

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.400
is where the dependency
is actually installed,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.520
you'll see the Polymer
Directory right here.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.955
And you'll see a bunch of
different files on there.

00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:56.330
So in the Polycast
Checklist, you

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.940
see there's an HTML import for
a Polymer, which is the Polymer

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.699
Directory right here.

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.240
And then you can see right here
in the PolycastChecklist.html

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.070
file, we import the Polymer
element file from the Polymer

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.090
Directory.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.080
And in the Polymer Directory,
we have a Polymer element file,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.110
which defines Polymer element
and is then used right here.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.215
So those are the basics of how
a Polymer element is laid out.

00:03:24.215 --> 00:03:26.320
In the next video, we'll
mock up our element

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.250
and start improving
it using Polymer.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.850
See you soon.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.200
