ROB DODSON: Hey, everyone.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.030
What's up?

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.510
It's Rob Dodson.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.926
Today on the podcast, we're
going to be taking a look back

00:00:07.926 --> 00:00:09.870
at our old core pages example.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.430
We're going to revise it so
it uses the new iron pages

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.120
element.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.370
Let's check it out.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.660
OK, so this is what we're
going to be building today.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.250
It is a cat-alogue.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.751
Get it?

00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:20.250
Yeah.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.770
Yeah.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.837
And it's basically kind of
like a little image carousel.

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:26.170
So you can see it's got these
Next and Previous buttons.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.660
As I click on them, it cycles
through different photos

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.409
of cats.

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:31.950
And you can see here that there
is this text field right here

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.180
and, as I change that
index, it is also

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.640
updating which cat photo we
are currently looking at.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.170
And so to build
this whole thing,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.550
we're going to use the
new iron pages element.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.936
Now, looking at our source
for our index file here,

00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:47.060
you can see that I've
already got my web components

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.340
polyfills in place.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.580
I've already gone ahead and
imported my cat-alogue element,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.970
and I've actually dropped it
into the page here as well.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.830
So we're pretty much
already set up to go.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.720
Now, thing that I
want to point out

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.920
is that I've got this
images directory over her,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.580
and, inside of there, I've just
got a few photos of some cats.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.510
These are taken from a member
of the Polymer Eng team's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.560
own feline friend
here that we're

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.780
using for our example,
which is pretty cool.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.770
Now, in the cat-alogue
element definition,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.290
you can see that this looks
like a pretty typical Polymer

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.880
element.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.140
At the top, we are
importing Polymer HTML

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.680
to make sure that dependency
is loaded and ready for us.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.560
That one has an
ID of cat-alogue,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.410
which matches the is property
that we have down here

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.044
in the Polymer constructor.

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:32.710
And the first thing
that I'm going to do

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.340
is just add a style to our
element to style the host.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.830
So we're styling the
tag itself, and I'm

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.310
sending it to display block.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.190
And I typically do this
for many of my elements,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.160
just because, by default, custom
elements are displayed inline,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.640
and usually I want things to be
either block or inline block.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.980
So I always do this first
to avoid any style weirdness

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.140
down the line.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.180
Now, with that in place, I'm
ready to go ahead and just

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.570
import iron pages.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.400
I've already installed
it using Bower.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.733
So I'm just going to pull it
out of the Bower components

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:06.530
directory and drop it
into my element here.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.520
Then I can use this handy
iron pages snippet to spit out

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.600
some iron pages boilerplate.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.680
This snippet, by the way, is
part of my snippets package.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.140
So I've got snippets for both
Sublime, which you can get over

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.690
here, and snippets for Atom,
which you get over here.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.970
They are really, really
useful, and they are set up

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.410
to support the iron elements
and the paper elements,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.900
so it makes it a little bit
easier to write code like this.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.358
And you'll see here
that iron pages

00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:36.560
looks a lot like the
old core pages element.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.610
It has a selected
attribute, and this

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.810
defines which of
these sections will

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.829
be displaying at any one point.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.370
Right now, it's just
defaulting to 0,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.110
so it'll be this
first section here,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.030
and I'm going to add a little
bit of content to this thing.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.780
I'm just going to drop
in some image tags,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.430
and these are going to
link up to our cat photos.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.690
And I've given them all Alt
attributes for accessibility,

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.470
and I also want to give them
all an explicit height of 375

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.970
pixels.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.900
So I'm going to give
them a pic class,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.944
just so I can style them.

00:03:02.944 --> 00:03:04.860
And then I'm just going
to give them a height,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.010
just for the sake
of this demo, so

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.426
that we don't have
images that are

00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:08.731
all wonky and different sizes.

00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:10.480
So now we can actually
preview this thing.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.680
And because iron pages is set
to display its first section

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.010
element, we get our
very first cat photo

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.080
showing up on screen,
which is pretty rad.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.150
Now, the next thing
I want to do is

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.160
create those buttons that
let me toggle back and forth

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.368
between different cat photos.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:25.550
So to do that, I'm going to
create a div underneath my iron

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.464
pages, and I'm just going
to call it controls.

00:03:28.464 --> 00:03:30.130
And, inside of here,
I'll just draw then

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.304
a couple of vanilla, just
regular, old HTML buttons.

00:03:35.304 --> 00:03:36.720
But the one thing
that's different

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.440
is that I'm going to give them
some of these declarative event

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.760
bindings or event
handlers, I should say.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.020
So these are really useful.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.853
These are features that
Polymer adds for you

00:03:46.853 --> 00:03:48.200
to set up event listeners.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.230
The nice thing about these is
that not only do they set up

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.570
the event listener, but they
handle removing the event

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.550
listener when the
element is taken out

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.580
of the Dom, which is really
handy for preventing things

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.990
like memory leaks.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.886
So right now I
don't know what I'm

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:02.510
going to do with
these methods, but I'm

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.080
going to go ahead and
just sort of stub them out

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.834
in my prototype.

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:07.250
So I'll go ahead
and I'll stub out

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.755
Go Previous as well as Go Next.

00:04:10.755 --> 00:04:13.380
And the reason why I don't know
what I'm going to do with these

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.300
is because I haven't really dug
into the Docs for iron pages

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.800
yet.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.550
So I don't really know how to
tell it to go next or back.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.510
To do that, we will hop
over to the elements catalog

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.270
at elements.polymer-project.org
and scope out the iron elements

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.800
and kind of scroll down the
page until we find iron pages,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.830
which is right down
here at the bottom.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.630
And I'll boost this
up a little bit,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.714
just so you can kind of
see this page a bit better

00:04:36.714 --> 00:04:38.588
because there's a couple
things that I really

00:04:38.588 --> 00:04:39.560
want to point out.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.310
The first is this source button.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.060
So this is something
that we just recently

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.310
added to the catalog.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.690
And what this does is,
as the name implies,

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.410
it allows you to go
to the actual GitHub

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.250
repo for the element that
you are interested in.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.156
So you can go here and, if
you want to file an issue,

00:04:55.156 --> 00:04:56.280
this is the place to do it.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.446
So you go to the element
source, you go to its repo,

00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:00.632
and you file an issue
specifically to that tag.

00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:02.340
And then the other
thing you can do here,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.790
obviously, is go and read
the source for the element.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.040
And this is super
handy when you're

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.820
trying to learn like what's
going on inside of an element.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.486
The other thing that
I want to point out

00:05:11.486 --> 00:05:14.150
that maybe some folks miss is
this little behaviors panel

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.890
down here.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.640
So right now you're
looking at iron pages,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.750
and you can see that it's got
this one property that it says

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.612
that it defines,
but actually, we

00:05:22.612 --> 00:05:25.070
know that there are these two
behaviors down here that it's

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.580
implementing, which means,
if you recall from one

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.520
of our previous episodes
where we discussed behaviors,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.920
we know that it's actually
mixing in additional properties

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.660
and methods that we
should have access to.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.940
So if we go down and click on
the iron Selectable Behavior,

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.460
we can see that there are
several properties that

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.210
are element implements,
and in fact, we've

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.924
got some methods
down here as well.

00:05:48.924 --> 00:05:51.090
So we've got methods for
selecting a specific value,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.180
selecting Next and selecting
Previous, et cetera.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.590
So that's actually
what I'm going

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.625
to use in those stubbed
out methods that I created.

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:01.890
I'm going to use these Select
Next and Previous methods.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.980
So back in my
elements definition,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.210
I'm going to give
iron pages an ID,

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.520
and this is just so I can
select it more easily using

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.300
Polymer's Automatic Node finding
so I don't have to do query

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.620
select or anything like that.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.920
And I just called it Pages.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.890
And now inside of go
prev, I can say this,

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.150
.$ pages to target that element,
and call Select Previous

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.890
and then go next.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.990
I will do the same thing
but, this time, I'll

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.080
call Select Next.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.640
So now I can switch
back to Chrome,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.348
and I've got my Next
and Previous buttons

00:06:31.348 --> 00:06:34.630
and our sort of cat-alogue
image carousel type thing

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.090
is now a bit more interactive
and we can flip through

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.340
all these beautiful cat photos.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.000
Now, the next thing I want to
do is add that little text input

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.720
in the middle, so
I can see which cat

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.130
photo I'm currently viewing.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.530
To do that, I will go back
to my element definition,

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.000
and I'm just going to drop
in a regular, old input type

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.695
equals text element.

00:06:54.695 --> 00:06:56.070
And the interesting
thing here is

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.010
to note that I'm going to
create a binding in its value,

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.730
and I'm going to call my
scope variable selected,

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.500
so that will be the shared
name for this bound value.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.100
But notice here
that I'm also going

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.630
to add two colons after this
and type the word input.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.160
So what is going on here?

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.510
Well, Polymer's
data binding system

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.260
is all secretly based on events.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.680
So when you have a
property in your element,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.670
maybe something called age,
for instance-- so let's see.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.190
So we have a property
called age, right?

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.850
When this property changes, if
you've set it to notify true,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.570
it is actually going to fire
an event called age changed.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.370
And Polymer listens
for these events

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.210
to know when it should
update its data bindings.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.650
But in the case of
native elements,

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.595
they fire their own
events when they change.

00:07:46.595 --> 00:07:50.150
The text input element fires
this input event anytime

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.060
it changes, and so we need to
teach Polymer about this event.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.890
We need to teach it
that hey, we want

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.210
this binding to
update whenever you

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.620
hear this event being fired.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.090
So that's what we're doing
with this special syntax here,

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:09.000
and this is how you can bind
to native HTML elements.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.550
OK, so with that set up, I can
go back up to my iron pages

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.890
element, and I can replace
its hard-coded selected

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.770
value with that
same scope variable,

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.950
and then I can just define
a property on my element,

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.060
for selected.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.730
I'll type it to number, and I'll
give it a default value of 0.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.880
So now, if we go ahead
and preview this thing,

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.420
we've got that 0
value down there,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.919
and you can see it's changing
as we click Next and Previous.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.850
We can also type
in the text input,

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.721
and because it's firing
that input event,

00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:38.179
we know to update
our bindings when

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.654
that changes there as well.

00:08:39.654 --> 00:08:41.070
Now, one of things
I want to do is

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.940
make those controls lay out a
bit nicer and, in Polymer 0.5,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.080
we always talked about
layout attributes.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.570
I used them in every
demo I ever did.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.970
In Polymer 1.0,
those have now been

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.480
moved to their own repo that
is called Iron Flex Layout.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.447
I'm going to import
Iron Flex Layout,

00:08:58.447 --> 00:09:00.280
and you can see here
it's got a special path

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.510
that I'm using here.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.150
So it's iron flex
layout/classes/iron flex

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.650
layout.html.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.810
And that's actually going to
load a bunch of CSS classes

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.490
that I can use for Flexbox.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.190
So we've switched from
attributes to classes now,

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.080
but it's basically the exact
same thing from Polymer 0.5

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.580
land.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.870
It's all the Flexbox shortcuts
that you know and love.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.970
So on my controls
div, I will add

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.660
layout, horizontal
and justified, and now

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.800
these guys layout really
nice, and we can still

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.022
toggle through them.

00:09:30.022 --> 00:09:31.230
So this is just super useful.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.260
I know a lot of
folks were wondering

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.460
where layout attributes went,
so that is where they are.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.030
They're off in Iron
Flex Layout now.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.410
And, for every element, if
you want to use those classes,

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.160
you'll need to import
them so that they

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.660
work within that scope.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.817
So important thing
to note there.

00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:45.400
Now, the last thing
I want to show off

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.710
is a feature that was very
popular in Polymer 0.5, which

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.850
was sometimes people
didn't want to have

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.680
a numeric selected index.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.190
So they would use
this special property

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:02.080
or the special attribute called
value adder, value attribute.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.340
They would add that to
their core pages element,

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.070
and they would then
specify an attribute

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.860
on all of their sections that
you should look for when you're

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.520
trying to update this thing.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.120
This has been replaced in
Polymer 1.0 with iron pages.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:22.100
Is now called
adder for selected.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.200
So we're going to use this
instead of the old value adder

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.310
to say that we're going to
create an attribute called data

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.460
cat, and this is just
a made-up attribute.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.290
I'm going to add it
to all of my sections,

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.470
and I'm going to give it a
value that sort of typifies

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.820
what is in that section.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.790
So this, since
it's a pretty cat,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.490
its data cat value is pretty.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.550
This is a vacation
cat, so it's vacation.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.310
Hacker cat gets hacker.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.070
Now, what's going to happen
is when that selected value

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.277
changes to some
string, iron pages

00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:55.360
is going to look through
these different sections.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.060
And let's say the
string is hacker.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.101
It's going to look through
the different sections

00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:01.570
and be like who has a
matching hacker data cat?

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.140
Ah, this guy, right here.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.210
And it's going to make
this the selected item.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.510
So if I go down and I just
change my selected property

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.270
to a string and
default it to hacker,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.680
now when we go in
preview, you'll

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.139
see that the text
input has hacker,

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:18.346
and as we're flipping through
the different sections,

00:11:18.346 --> 00:11:20.220
it changes to our
different data cat values.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.670
And we can type
in a new one here.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.170
It's going to
disappear for a second

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.210
because it sort of goes null for
a bit, but we can type in ones

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.320
and see those
different cats as well.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.510
So there you have it.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.770
Nice and simple, and with
some pretty small updates,

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.329
we're up and running again.

00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:35.620
That's it for this week, folks.
