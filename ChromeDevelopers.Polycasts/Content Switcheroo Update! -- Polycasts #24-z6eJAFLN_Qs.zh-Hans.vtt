00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.730
大家好
ROB DODSON: Hey, everyone.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.920
今天在播客上我们要回顾一下
Today on the podcast, we're going to be taking a look back

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.870
以前的core页面例子
at our old core pages example.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.430
我们要修正一下它 让它使用新的iron页面
We're going to revise it so it uses the new iron pages

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.120
元素
element.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.370
我们来看看吧
Let's check it out.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.660
好的 这是我们今天要做的东西
OK, so this is what we're going to be building today.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.250
这是一个猫录（catalogue本意为目录）
It is a cat-alogue.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.750
现在知道了吗
Get it?

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.250
对啦
Yeah.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.770
对啦
Yeah.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.830
它基本上有点像一个小小的图像传送带
And it's basically kind of like a little image carousel.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.170
所以你能看到它有这些下一张和上一张的选项
So you can see it's got these Next and Previous buttons.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.660
我点击它们的时候 就会循环播放不同的猫咪
As I click on them, it cycles through different photos

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.400
图片
of cats.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.950
而且你能看见这里有文本区域
And you can see here that there is this text field right here

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.180
当我修改上面的索引时 它也会
and, as I change that index, it is also

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.640
更新我们正在看的猫咪图片
updating which cat photo we are currently looking at.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.170
为了建立这套东西
And so to build this whole thing,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.550
我们要用新的iron页面元素
we're going to use the new iron pages element.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.930
现在 你看我们的索引文件的源
Now, looking at our source for our index file here,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.060
你可以看见我的网页元素
you can see that I've already got my web components

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.340
多项填充已经就位
polyfills in place.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.580
我已经引入了我的猫录元素
I've already gone ahead and imported my cat-alogue element,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.970
而且已经将它放在页面里了 就在这儿
and I've actually dropped it into the page here as well.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.830
那么我们差不多准备好了
So we're pretty much already set up to go.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.720
现在 我想指出的是
Now, thing that I want to point out

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.920
我将图像目录放在这儿
is that I've got this images directory over here,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.580
而在那里面有几张猫咪的照片
and, inside of there, I've just got a few photos of some cats.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.510
这些照片照的是一名Polymer Eng团队成员的
These are taken from a member of the Polymer Eng team's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.560
猫科动物朋友 我们现在当范例
own feline friend here that we're

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.780
用一下 这还蛮酷的
using for our example, which is pretty cool.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.770
现在 在猫录元素定义中
Now, in the cat-alogue element definition,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.290
你可以看见这像一个挺典型的Polymer
you can see that this looks like a pretty typical Polymer

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.880
元素
element.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.140
在上面 我们在引入Polymer HTML
At the top, we are importing Polymer HTML

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.680
来确保依赖性被载入以备我们使用
to make sure that dependency is loaded and ready for us.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.560
那个有一个猫录的编码
That one has an ID of cat-alogue,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.410
跟Polymer构造器
which matches the is property that we have down here

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.040
下面的属性相匹配
in the Polymer constructor.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.710
我要做的第一件事是
And the first thing that I'm going to do

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.340
给我们的元素添加样式以使主元素具有样式
is just add a style to our element to style the host.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.830
那么我们在使标签本身具有样式 我将它
So we're styling the tag itself, and I'm

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.310
发送到显示模块
sending it to display block.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.190
我谨慎的处理这儿的很多元素
And I typically do this for many of my elements,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.160
只是因为 根据默认 定制元素是内联显示的
just because, by default, custom elements are displayed inline,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.640
而我通常觉得它们要么是模块 要么是内联模块
and usually I want things to be either block or inline block.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.980
所以我经常第一步就做这个以完全避免任何样式上的
So I always do this first to avoid any style weirdness

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.140
差错
down the line.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.180
现在 那个已经就位 我要往下进行
Now, with that in place, I'm ready to go ahead and just

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.570
引入iron页面了
import iron pages.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.400
我已经用Bower安装了它
I've already installed it using Bower.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.730
所以我只用将它从Bower元素目录中
So I'm just going to pull it out of the Bower components

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.530
提出来并放在我这里的元素里
directory and drop it into my element here.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.520
之后我就可以用这个方便的iron页面片段点击出
Then I can use this handy iron pages snippet to spit out

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.600
一些iron页面样板
some iron pages boilerplate.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.680
顺便说一下 这个片段是我的片段包的一部分
This snippet, by the way, is part of my snippets package.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.140
所以我有Sublime的片段 从这儿可以看到
So I've got snippets for both Sublime, which you can get over

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.690
你也可以看到  还有Atom的片段
here, and snippets for Atom, which you get over here.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.970
它们相当相当有用 而且它们都设定好了
They are really, really useful, and they are set up

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.410
可以支持iron元素和纸张元素
to support the iron elements and the paper elements,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.900
所以它使写这样的代码变得容易一点了
so it makes it a little bit easier to write code like this.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.350
而且你可以在这看见iron页面
And you'll see here that iron pages

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.560
很像老的core页面元素
looks a lot like the old core pages element.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.610
它有一个被选择的属性 这
It has a selected attribute, and this

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.810
决定了哪一个选项
defines which of these sections will

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.820
在某一时刻显示出来
be displaying at any one point.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.370
现在 默认为零
Right now, it's just defaulting to 0,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.110
所以它会是这里的第一个选项
so it'll be this first section here,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.030
我要在这东西上再加一点内容
and I'm going to add a little bit of content to this thing.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.780
我要放几个图像标签进来
I'm just going to drop in some image tags,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.430
这些可以链接我们的猫咪照片
and these are going to link up to our cat photos.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.690
而且我为了可供访问给它们设定了所有的Alt属性
And I've given them all Alt attributes for accessibility,

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.470
而且我想把它们所有都明确地设定一个375像素的
and I also want to give them all an explicit height of 375

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.970
高度
pixels.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.900
所以我要给它们一个pic类
So I'm going to give them a pic class,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.940
那样我就可以使它们具有样式
just so I can style them.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.860
之后我要给它们设定高度
And then I'm just going to give them a height,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.010
只是为了展示方便
just for the sake of this demo, so

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.420
那样我们就不用看着有差错的
that we don't have images that are

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.730
都是不同尺寸的图像了
all wonky and different sizes.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.480
那么现在我们其实可以预览这个东西了
So now we can actually preview this thing.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.680
因为iron页面被设定为显示它的第一个选项
And because iron pages is set to display its first section

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.010
元素 我们的第一张猫咪照片
element, we get our very first cat photo

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.080
出现在屏幕上 真是顶呱呱啊
showing up on screen, which is pretty rad.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.150
现在 我想做的下一件事是
Now, the next thing I want to do is

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.160
创建可以让我在不同猫咪照片中
create those buttons that let me toggle back and forth

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.360
向前向后切换的按钮
between different cat photos.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.550
为了达到目的 我要在我的iron下面创建一个div
So to do that, I'm going to create a div underneath my iron

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.460
页面 我就打算命名为controls
pages, and I'm just going to call it controls.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.130
还有 在这里面 我就放置
And, inside of here, I'll just drop in

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.300
几个普通的 平常的 老的HTML按钮
a couple of vanilla, just regular, old HTML buttons.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.720
但是有一点不同的是
But the one thing that's different

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.440
我要给它们设一些声明式事件绑定
is that I'm going to give them some of these declarative event

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.760
或者我应该说事件处理程序
event bindings or event handlers, I should say.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.020
这些是很有用的
So these are really useful.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.850
这些是Polymer为你添加的特性
These are features that Polymer adds for you

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.200
好设定事件接听项
to set up event listeners.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.230
这些东西的好处是它们不只设置好
The nice thing about these is that not only do they set up

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.570
事件接听项 而且还在元素被从Dom取出时
the event listener, but they handle removing the event

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.550
移除事件接听项
listener when the element is taken out

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.580
这对于预防像内存泄漏的事
of the Dom, which is really handy for preventing things

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.990
是非常有用的
like memory leaks.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.880
那么现在我不知道
So right now I don't know what I'm

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.510
怎样运用 但是
going to do with these methods, but I'm

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.080
我会继续 差不多在我的原型里将它们
going to go ahead and just sort of stub them out

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.830
连接起来
in my prototype.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.250
所以我要继续预留出
So I'll go ahead and I'll stub out

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.750
转到上一页和转到下一页
Go Previous as well as Go Next.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.380
还有我之所以不知道该对这些怎么办
And the reason why I don't know what I'm going to do with these

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.300
是因为我还没有
is because I haven't 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.300
深入钻研iron页面的
really dug into the Docs for iron pages

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.550
所以我真的不知道怎么告诉它继续或者后退
So I don't really know how to tell it to go next or back.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.510
为了能做那个 我们要跳到元素目录
To do that, we will hop over to the elements catalog

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.270
element.polymer-project.org 然后找到iron元素
at elements.polymer-project.org and scope out the iron elements

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.800
再将页面拉下来直到找到iron页面
and kind of scroll down the page until we find iron pages,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.830
就在这底下呢
which is right down here at the bottom.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.630
我把它放大一点
And I'll boost this up a little bit,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.710
你们就可以更清楚地看到这个页面了
just so you can kind of see this page a bit better

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.580
这儿有几件我得
because there's a couple things that I really

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.560
指出来的事
want to point out.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.310
第一件是这个源按钮
The first is this source button.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.060
这个其实是我们最近才
So this is something that we just recently

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.310
添加到目录的
added to the catalog.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.690
它的功能是 顾名思义
And what this does is, as the name implies,

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.410
可以让你真的去到GitHub
it allows you to go to the actual GitHub

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.250
repo找你感兴趣的元素
repo for the element that you are interested in.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.150
所以你可以去到这 还有 如果你想提交一个问题
So you can go here and, if you want to file an issue,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.280
就在这儿点击提交
this is the place to do it.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.440
你可以点击元素源 你到它的repo
So you go to the element source, you go to its repo,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.630
并专门向那个标签提交问题
and you file an issue specifically to that tag.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.340
另一件你需要做的是
And then the other thing you can do here,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.790
很明显 是阅读那个元素的源
obviously, is go and read the source for the element.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.040
当你在深入学习一个元素的时候
And this is super handy when you're

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.820
这可是超级方便
trying to learn like what's going on inside of an element.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.480
另一件我想指出的事是
The other thing that I want to point out

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.150
也许有些人易忽略这底下的
that maybe some folks miss is this little behaviors panel

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.890
行为面板
down here.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.640
那么现在你看着iron页面
So right now you're looking at iron pages,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.750
然后你可以看见有这个属性显示
and you can see that it's got this one property that it says

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.610
它能定义 但是实际上我们
that it defines, but actually, we

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.070
知道这下面有两个行为在运行
know that there are these two behaviors down here that it's

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.580
即意味着 如果你能回想起
implementing, which means, if you recall from one

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.520
前面一集我们讨论过行为的话
of our previous episodes where we discussed behaviors,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.920
我们知道这实际上混合了附加的属性
we know that it's actually mixing in additional properties

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.660
和方法 而这些我们可以使用
and methods that we should have access to.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.940
那么如果我们到下面点击iron Selectable Behavior
So if we go down and click on the iron Selectable Behavior,

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.460
我们能看到有几个是元素
we can see that there are several properties that

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.210
的属性 实际上我们
are element implements, and in fact, we've

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.920
在这下面也有一些方法
got some methods down here as well.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.090
那么我们有一个方法 可以选择特定值
So we've got methods for selecting a specific value,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.180
可以选择下一页和前一页之类的
selecting Next and selecting Previous, et cetera.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.590
所以那就是我要
So that's actually what I'm going

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.620
在我连接起来的那些方法中使用的
to use in those stubbed out methods that I created.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.890
我要用这些选择下一页和前一页的方法
I'm going to use these Select Next and Previous methods.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.980
回到我的元素定义中
So back in my elements definition,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.210
我要给iron页面一个ID
I'm going to give iron pages an ID,

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.520
这样我就可以用Polymer's Automatic Node
and this is just so I can select it more easily using

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.300
来更方便地选择 而且我就不用做查询选取
Polymer's Automatic Node finding so I don't have to do query

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.620
之类的工作了
select or anything like that.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.920
我给它命名Pages
And I just called it Pages.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.890
在go prev里 我可以输入这个
And now inside of go prev, I can say this,

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.150
.$ pages来把那个元素定为目标 
.$ pages to target that element,

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.150
然后输入Select Previous
and call Select Previous

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.890
然后继续
and then go next.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.990
我会做相同的事 但是这次我会
I will do the same thing but, this time, I'll

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.080
输入选择下一页
call Select Next.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.640
那么现在我可以切换回Chrome
So now I can switch back to Chrome,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.340
我设好了下一页和前一页选项
and I've got my Next and Previous buttons

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.630
还有类似猫录图像圆盘传送带的东西
and our sort of cat-alogue image carousel type thing

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.090
现在完善了更多 我们可以翻看
is now a bit more interactive and we can flip through

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.340
这些漂亮的猫咪图片了
all these beautiful cat photos.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.000
现在我想做的下一件事是将那个小文本
Now, the next thing I want to do is add that little text input

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.720
加在中间 那我就可以知道我正在
in the middle, so I can see which cat

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.130
看哪张猫咪图片了
photo I'm currently viewing.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.530
为了做到那样 我要回到我的元素定义
To do that, I will go back to my element definition,

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.000
之后我只是放一个普通的 以前的输入类型进来
and I'm just going to drop in a regular, old input type

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.690
它相当于文本元素
equals text element.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.070
还有这儿有趣的是
And the interesting thing here is

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.010
注意我要在它的value里创建一个链接
to note that I'm going to create a binding in its value,

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.730
我还要范围变量命名为selected
and I'm going to call my scope variable selected,

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.500
那这个名字就是这个被链接的值所共用了
so that will be the shared name for this bound value.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.100
但是注意这里 我也要
But notice here that I'm also going

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.630
在输入这个词后面加上冒号
to add two colons after this and type the word input.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.160
那这是在干嘛呢
So what is going on here?

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.510
这个嘛 Polymer的数据连接系统
Well, Polymer's data binding system

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.260
都是秘密建立在事件上的
is all secretly based on events.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.680
所以当你的元素里有一个属性
So when you have a property in your element,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.670
也许是一个叫age的 举个例子 我们来看看
maybe something called age, for instance-- so let's see.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.190
那么我们有一个叫age的元素 对吧
So we have a property called age, right?

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.850
当这个元素改变时 如果你设定它为正确的选项
When this property changes, if you've set it to notify true,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.570
它其实会激发一个叫做age changed事件
it is actually going to fire an event called age changed.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.370
而Polymer会留神这些事件
And Polymer listens for these events

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.210
以得知什么时候应该更新它的数据连接
to know when it should update its data bindings.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.650
但是在本地元素的例子中
But in the case of native elements,

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.590
当改变的时候它们激发它们自己的事件
they fire their own events when they change.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.150
任何时候它有改变 文本输入元素就会
The text input element fires this input event anytime

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.060
激发这个输入事件 
it changes,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.060
所以我们需要教会Polymer关于这个事件的东西
and so we need to teach Polymer about this event.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.890
我们要教会它如何操作  我们要
We need to teach it that hey, we want

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.210
这个链接是为了只要你得知这个事件
this binding to update whenever you

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.620
被激发就会更新
hear this event being fired.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.090
所以我们才要写这个特别句法
So that's what we're doing with this special syntax here,

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:09.000
这是你可以链接到本地HTML元素的方法
and this is how you can bind to native HTML elements.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.550
好的 设好了那个 我可以回到我的iron页面
OK, so with that set up, I can go back up to my iron pages

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.890
元素 并且我可以将它的硬编码的 
element, and I can replace its hard-coded selected

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.770
值换成那个同样的范围变量
value with that same scope variable,

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.950
之后我就可以在我的元素给
and then I can just define a property on my element,

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.060
定义一个属性
for selected.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.730
我要将其归类为number 我还要给它设一个默认值为0
I'll type it to number, and I'll give it a default value of 0.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.880
那么现在 如果我们想预览这东西的话
So now, if we go ahead and preview this thing,

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.420
我们有一个0值在下面
we've got that 0 value down there,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.910
而且你可以看见当我们点击后一页和前一页时它会改变
and you can see it's changing as we click Next and Previous.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:34.850
我们也可以点击输入文本
We can also type in the text input,

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.720
因为它在激发那个输入事件
and because it's firing that input event,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.170
我们知道一旦改变就会
we know to update our bindings when

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.650
更新我们的链接
that changes there as well.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.070
现在 我想做的一件事是
Now, one of things I want to do is

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.940
改进一下那些控制布局 还有 Polymer0.5
make those controls lay out a bit nicer and, in Polymer 0.5,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.080
我们总是谈论布局属性
we always talked about layout attributes.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.570
我在我做的每次展示都用
I used them in every demo I ever did.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.970
在Polymer1.0 那些已经被
In Polymer 1.0, those have now been

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.480
移到它们自己的repo 叫做Iron Flex Layout
moved to their own repo that is called Iron Flex Layout.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.440
我要引入Iron FLex Layout
I'm going to import Iron Flex Layout,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.280
你可以看见这里有一条我正在用的
and you can see here it's got a special path

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.510
特殊路径
that I'm using here.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.150
那么是iron flex layout/classes/iron flex
So it's iron flex layout/classes/iron flex

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.650
layout.html.
layout.html.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.810
其实这可以加载一些我能在伸缩编辑上
And that's actually going to load a bunch of CSS classes

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.490
用的CSS类
that I can use for Flexbox.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.190
那我们已经从属性转换到类了
So we've switched from attributes to classes now,

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.080
但它跟Polymer0.5
but it's basically the exact same thing from Polymer 0.5

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.580
基本是一样的
land.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.870
这些事你知道的并喜爱的Flexbox捷径
It's all the Flexbox shortcuts that you know and love.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.970
所以在我的controls div我要添加
So on my controls div, I will add

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.660
布局 水平的 可选择的 现在
layout, horizontal and justified, and now

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.800
这个布局就很好了 而且我们仍然可以
these guys layout really nice, and we can still

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.020
在照片之间切换
toggle through them.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.230
所以这个超级有用
So this is just super useful.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.260
我知道很多人在疑惑
I know a lot of folks were wondering

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.460
布局属性去哪了 原来在这
where layout attributes went, so that is where they are.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.030
它们现在到Iron Flex Layout了
They're off in Iron Flex Layout now.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.410
而且对于每一个元素 如果你想用那些类的话
And, for every element, if you want to use those classes,

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.160
你需要引入它们 以使它们
you'll need to import them so that they

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.660
在范围内工作
work within that scope.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.810
所以很重要 需要注意
So important thing to note there.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.400
现在 我想展示的最后一件事是
Now, the last thing I want to show off

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.710
Polymer0.5中很受欢迎的一个特征
is a feature that was very popular in Polymer 0.5, which

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.850
人们有时候不想有
was sometimes people didn't want to have

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.680
一个数值的selected索引
a numeric selected index.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.190
所以他们会用这个特殊的属性
So they would use this special property

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:02.080
或者这个特殊的属性 叫做值加法器,值属性
or the special attribute called value adder, value attribute.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.340
它可以把那添加到他们的core页面元素
They would add that to their core pages element,

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.070
它们之后还会在所有
and they would then specify an attribute

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.860
当你尝试更新这东西时你该找的分区
on all of their sections that you should look for when you're

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.520
指定一个属性
trying to update this thing.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.120
这在Polymer1.0中被iron页面所替换
This has been replaced in Polymer 1.0 with iron pages.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:22.100
现在叫做可供选择的加法器
Is now called adder for selected.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.200
那么我们要这个代替老的值加法器
So we're going to use this instead of the old value adder

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.310
来输入我们要创建一个叫做猫
to say that we're going to create an attribute called data

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.460
的属性 这个属性就是编制的
cat, and this is just a made-up attribute.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.290
我要将它添加到我所有的分区
I'm going to add it to all of my sections,

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.470
我还要给它一个值来代表
and I'm going to give it a value that sort of typifies

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.820
分区里的东西
what is in that section.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.790
那么这个 由于这是只漂亮的猫咪
So this, since it's a pretty cat,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.490
它的猫的值就很适合
its data cat value is pretty.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.550
这是只度假猫咪 所以这是度假猫
This is a vacation cat, so it's vacation.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.310
黑客猫咪就是黑客猫了
Hacker cat gets hacker.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.070
现在 就下来要发生的是 当那个被选择的值
Now, what's going to happen is when that selected value

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.270
改变为字符串时 iron页面
changes to some string, iron pages

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.360
会浏览这些不同的分区
is going to look through these different sections.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.060
那我们假设字符串是黑客
And let's say the string is hacker.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.100
它就会浏览这些不同分区
It's going to look through the different sections

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.570
像是在问谁有一只匹配的黑客猫呀
and be like who has a matching hacker data cat?

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.140
啊 是这里这只啊
Ah, this guy, right here.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.210
之后它会使这个成为被选择的项
And it's going to make this the selected item.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.510
所以如果我到下面直接将我的被选择属性
So if I go down and I just change my selected property

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.270
自动改为 默认是黑客猫
to a string and default it to hacker,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.680
现在当我们预览时 你会看见
now when we go in preview, you'll

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.130
文本输入是黑客
see that the text input has hacker,

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.340
而且当我们浏览不同分区时
and as we're flipping through the different sections,

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.220
它会改成我们的不同的猫咪数据值
it changes to our different data cat values.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.670
我们在这里可以输入一个新的
And we can type in a new one here.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.170
它会消失一下
It's going to disappear for a second

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.210
因为它像是要变一下空值 但我们可以输入新的
because it sort of goes null for a bit, but we can type in new ones

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.320
并看见那些不同的猫咪
and see those different cats as well.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.510
就是这些了
So there you have it.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.770
简洁明了 有着一些小小的更新
Nice and simple, and with some pretty small updates,

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.320
我们又可以正常运作了
we're up and running again.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.620
正如你们看到的 这就是本周的内容
