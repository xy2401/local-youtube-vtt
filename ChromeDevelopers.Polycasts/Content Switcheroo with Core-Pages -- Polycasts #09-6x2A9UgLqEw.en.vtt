00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:04.120
Hey, everyone.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.390
What's up?

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.200
It's Rob Dodson.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.853
In today's episode
of Polycasts, I'm

00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:08.990
going to show you how to
dynamically swap around

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.080
all the content in
your application using

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.889
the core pages element,
so check it out.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.680
The hallmark of any
single-page application

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.480
is that it doesn't
refresh the page

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.984
as the user is navigating
to different sections.

00:00:19.984 --> 00:00:21.650
So using the Polymer
site as an example,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.312
you can see that, as I'm
clicking around the menu items,

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:25.770
all the content on
the page is just

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.610
sort of instantaneously
changing.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.550
It makes the whole app have this
really nice, snappy feel to it.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.720
Now there's a few ways that
you can achieve this effect.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.850
The most basic, and the
one that I'll cover today,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.190
involves showing and hiding
different bits of content that

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.490
are already available
on the page,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.200
basically just telling
some to display

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.410
block and others
to display none.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.340
There are other
strategies which include

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.700
using Ajax to go talk to your
server, grab some content,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.740
and then inject that back into
the document or piping data

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.710
to templates that you already
have that are on the page

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.552
and then sort of inflating them.

00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:01.052
All right.

00:01:01.052 --> 00:01:02.040
I'm going to cover
these other two

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.960
techniques in future
episodes, but let's start off

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.470
with a really
simple example today

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.292
just switching some
sections on and off.

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:10.000
So here I am in Sublime,
and I've already

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.080
gone ahead and set up a
really simple project.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.121
In my bower.json, I've
included the core elements

00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:16.980
and installed everything to
my Bower Components directory.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.063
So to get rolling, the
first thing I'm going to do

00:01:19.063 --> 00:01:21.510
is open my elements HTML
file and add the core pages

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.045
elements so it gets imported.

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:29.270
Then in my index HTML file,
I'll write out a core pages tag,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.460
and I'm going to give it
a selected attribute of 0.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.300
I'm also going to go in and
set some kind of boilerplate

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.986
content up.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.390
Now, the selected attribute
up here is really important,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.180
and the way it works
is it basically

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.310
tells core pages which of
its children to display.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.750
It's kind of like an
index on an array.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.850
So this child right here
is going to be child 0,

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.870
this child is child 1, and this
section is going to be child 2.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.140
Since I've set
selected equal to 1,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.630
it's going to actually try
to render this portfolio

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.544
section down here.

00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:09.639
If you hop on into Chrome
and refresh the page,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.430
you should see that portfolio
content showing up right there.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.712
But you're not limited
to using a numeric index.

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:17.170
If you give your
core pages element

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.690
a value attribute
instead, you can

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.040
select any child that
matches that value attribute.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.424
I'm going to set value
attribute to data category.

00:02:28.424 --> 00:02:30.590
This is an attribute that
I've just totally made up.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.950
And I'm going to give
each of these sections

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.730
a matching data
category attribute.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.870
Now, if I set my selected value
to contact, what that does

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.320
is it tells core pages to find
the child with a matching data

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.130
category of contact.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.710
Looking through our
sections, we can

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.040
see that this one right
down here matches.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.310
And so, when we hop over to
Chrome, refresh the page,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.620
we should see our Contact
section is now displaying.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.870
All right, so if you
recall in the last episode,

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.440
I wrapped all of my elements
in an auto-binding template

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.180
element.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.800
Now, we can do the
same thing here

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.080
to connect our core
pages element to a menu.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.732
Let's check it out.

00:03:07.732 --> 00:03:10.190
All right, I've added a little
bit more markup to our page,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.980
so, now we have a
core drawer panel.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.360
It's holding all of our pages.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.867
We also have header panels and
toolbars, a bunch of elements

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:17.450
that we've shown in
previous episodes.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.824
And if you missed
those episodes,

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:22.440
we've got links to them
down in the show notes.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.250
First thing I'm going
do is wrap everything

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.090
inside of an
auto-binding template,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.880
so I'm going to use that is
equals auto-binding attribute,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.440
grab all my content,
paste it inside there,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.040
and also give my
template an ID of app,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.370
so that way I can refer to
it later using JavaScript.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.100
Next, I'm going to pop open
my elements HTML file and drop

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.710
in a core menu and
core items imports.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.000
And back in my index file,
I'll write out a core menu

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.591
and populate it with
items that match

00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:50.715
all of our page categories.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.290
Now comes the magic moment.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.792
Because core menu and core pages
extend the same common parent

00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:02.250
called core selector,
it means they

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.475
can both take advantage
of value attribute.

00:04:04.475 --> 00:04:06.620
I'm going to give
each of my core items

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.990
a data category that matches
the core page's data categories,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.590
and I can set my selected
value equal to a scope

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.060
variable, which I'm just going
to make up and call page.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.050
Then I can go down to
my core pages section

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.600
and give it a scope variable
for its selected value,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.130
also called page.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.560
And now, in effect, I've
linked these two elements,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.270
my menu to my pages.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.324
If I hop open to Chrome
and refresh the page,

00:04:32.324 --> 00:04:34.240
you'll see that as I'm
clicking my menu items,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.890
it's also updating
the page content.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.040
To set a default page,
I'm going to select

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.300
the auto-binding template
in my app JS file

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.820
and give it an initial
value for its page variable.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.395
I'll just go ahead and
set page equal to home.

00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:56.840
Now when I set up
my application,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.754
it's displaying the
home page by default.

00:04:59.754 --> 00:05:01.170
All right, now
that you can change

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.690
between the different
states in your application

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.630
using core pages, you
can start to think

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.690
about adding additional
things like routing.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.231
That's exactly what we're going
to cover in the next episode,

00:05:09.231 --> 00:05:10.270
so be sure to subscribe.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.680

so much for watching,

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.040
