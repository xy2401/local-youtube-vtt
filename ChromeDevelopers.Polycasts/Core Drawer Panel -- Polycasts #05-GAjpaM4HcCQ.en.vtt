Hey everybody, what's up?

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:02.370
It's Rob Dodson.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.560
And in today's
episode of Polycast,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.476
we're going to be picking
up where we left off

00:00:05.476 --> 00:00:07.070
last time with the
core header panel.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.380
We're going to take that mobile
site that we started to build,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.630
and we're going to incorporate
one more element called

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.210
core drawer panel so we get an
experience that looks really

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.060
great both on our desktop
and on our mobile device.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.840
So let's dive in.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.930
So this is where we left
things off in our last video.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.466
We've got the site
that looks really

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.590
great on our mobile device.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.150
But on our desktop, it's
just a little stretched out.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.770
I mean, I'm not even showing
my browser at full width here.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.437
What I'd like to do is to add a
sidebar over here on the left,

00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:32.020
and that way our
content is just going

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.380
to look a little bit nicer.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.210
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.501
going to use a core drawer
panel, which is a responsive

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:39.390
container that combines a side
drawer with a main content

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.170
area.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.010
Now any content that you
place in the drawer panel

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.820
that you give a
drawer attribute to

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.290
is going to actually end up
over here in your sidebar.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.990
Likewise, any content that
you have a main attribute on

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.632
is going to end up
in your main area.

00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:53.340
Now the cool thing
about the drawer panel

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.470
is that it's actually
responsive by default.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.870
And so that means that,
on smaller screens,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.610
it knows to move the
drawer out of the way.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.580
And we can just wire it up to
something like a hamburger menu

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.910
to display that drawer again
when someone clicks on it.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.550
Now by default,
the drawer panel is

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.560
going to collapse when
it's at about 640 pixels.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.310
And so if we want to
change that behavior,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.017
we can give it a
responsive width attribute

00:01:17.017 --> 00:01:19.100
and set the responsive
width to a different value.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.985
For instance, we could set it
equal to like 800 pixels if we

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:24.700
would prefer it to
collapse at that size.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.470
Now, you might be wondering, how
does the drawer panel actually

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.360
know where to
render its children?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.860
So let me show you
a little example.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.080
Over here on the left,
we have the mark up

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.288
that we've been working with.

00:01:33.288 --> 00:01:35.650
You can consider
this our Light Dom.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.370
In the center here, we've got
the kind of abbreviated source

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.950
for the core drawer
panel itself.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.606
We can say this
is our Shadow Dom.

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:42.980
And over here on
the right, we've

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.688
got a rendering of
what our final page is

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:45.660
going to look like.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.110
So notice these content elements
inside of the drawer panel.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.386
These are what are known
as insertion points.

00:01:52.386 --> 00:01:54.260
And what insertion points
do is they actually

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.500
invite content from the Light
Dom over into the Shadow Dom.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.144
This is done through a process
that is known as distribution.

00:02:01.144 --> 00:02:02.560
You can think of
distribution kind

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.929
of like pointing a movie
projector at a wall.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.470
So what we're doing
is we're actually

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.470
taking the content from
our drawer element here.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.510
And it's being projected
into the Shadow Dom,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.280
just like you would project
video content at a wall.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.490
And that's being displayed
over here in our drawer area.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.310
Likewise, with
this main element,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.980
it's being projected
into the Shadow Dom.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.752
And that gets rendered
as our primary content.

00:02:24.752 --> 00:02:26.210
Now the cool thing
here is that you

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.602
can have all sorts
of markup and CSS

00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:30.060
and whatever you
want in the Shadow

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.640
Dom that frames these elements.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.540
So we can create really complex
structures in the Shadow Dom

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.770
and then take advantage
of them in the Light Dom

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.100
just by using a
few lines of HTML.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.860
I think that's really powerful.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.318
So over in our code editor,
the first thing I'm going to do

00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:46.740
is open up the
elements HTML file.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.896
And I'm going to import
the definition for the tags

00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:50.770
that we're going to be
using in this example.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.274
So I'm going to import
the core drawer panel.

00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:54.690
I'm going to import
the core menu.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.560
And I'm going to
import the core item.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.350
Now back in my
next HTML file, I'm

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.740
going to create a core
drawer panel element.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.250
And then I'm just going to grab
this header panel right here

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.050
and actually move it up
into my drawer panel.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.885
And I've got to remember to
include that main attribute.

00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:13.790
And that way, it's going to
render as our primary content.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.290
And we can ditch
the flex attribute,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.380
because that drawer
panel is going

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.395
to handle laying this
element out for us.

00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:21.360
Now I'm also going to
create a second header panel

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.014
inside of here.

00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:23.680
And this is going to
be the content that

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.379
goes into our drawer.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.670
So I've got to make sure to
give it a drawer attribute.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.465
And then I'm just
going to create

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:30.060
a toolbar inside of here.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.430
And we'll say, give it a
title of something like, menu.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.700
Then below that, we'll throw
in that core menu element

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.540
that we imported, and
we'll create two menu items

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.090
inside of here.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.920
We'll just give each
of these a label

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.110
that will represent the
different pages in our site.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.780
So we'll say one and two.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.759
Now we're going to add
some CSS and JavaScript

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:50.550
to our application.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.080
But first, I want to go down
here to our core icon button.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.952
And I want to give
it an ID of nav icon.

00:03:56.952 --> 00:03:58.660
That's just going to
make it a lot easier

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.672
to work with later on.

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.630
I'm also going to go up
to my core drawer panel

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.520
and give it an ID
of drawer panel.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.950
Now, over in our
app CSS, I'm just

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.730
going to paste in a few styles.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.500
And this is some
pretty typical stuff.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.610
We're setting a
background color.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.035
We're setting another background
color in our drawer panel.

00:04:15.035 --> 00:04:17.160
But there's this really
interesting style down here

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.326
at the bottom where I'm
saying, when the core drawer

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:24.600
panel is not narrow, the nav
icon should be display none.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.410
So what does that mean exactly?

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.420
Well, if we hop over
to the documentation,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.960
and we scroll down to
the Attributes section

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.360
for the core drawer
panel, you'll

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.100
see that there's this
narrow attribute right here.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.810
And basically what happens
with the narrow attribute is,

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.810
when the door
panel is collapsed,

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.570
the narrow attribute
gets set to true

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.410
and it ends up
showing up on the tag.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.200
When the drawer panel
is at full size,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.890
the narrow attribute
gets removed.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.140
So basically, what our
CSS is saying right here

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.642
is, hide the hamburger
menu when we're expanded,

00:04:54.642 --> 00:04:56.225
and then show it
when we're collapsed.

00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:58.860
It moves out of the way,
and that hammer icon

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.580
appears up there
in the top left.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.117
And if we stretch
things out again,

00:05:03.117 --> 00:05:04.950
you'll see that the
hamburger menu is hidden

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.960
and the drawer panel
slides back out.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.620
Pretty cool.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.290
Now, there's one
missing piece here.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.300
When I click the
hamburger menu, I

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.770
want the drawer to
actually slide back out.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.980
So how are we going
to go about that?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.500
Well if we hop back in
to the documentation,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.527
and if we scroll down
to the methods section,

00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:23.610
you'll see that there's a
toggle panel method here

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.284
which allows us to toggle
the panel open and closed.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:27.700
So in our application,
we're going

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.260
to create a new
file called app js.

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:34.224
And then inside
this file, I'm just

00:05:34.224 --> 00:05:36.360
going to paste in a
little bit of JavaScript.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.430
And I'll walk you through
what's going on here.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.065
We're first listening for
the polymer ready event.

00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:43.190
That way, we're guaranteed
that all of our elements

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.356
have upgraded and
they're ready to rock.

00:05:45.356 --> 00:05:47.230
We're taking the nav
icon in the drawer panel

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.510
that we gave IDs to earlier.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.052
And we're telling the nav icon
to listen to any click events.

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:53.509
And when it hears
a click event, it

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.420
should tell the drawer
panel to toggle open.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.530
So if we preview this is
our application, click

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.169
the hamburger, it
opens the drawer.

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.710
And then we can mess around with
our menu buttons if we want.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.900
Clicking the grey area
collapses it again.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.630
So just like that, we have
a fully responsive website.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.180
And we only had to write a
tiny bit of CSS and JavaScript.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.431
I think that's pretty awesome.

00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:12.846
In the next episode, I'm going
to show you one weird trick

00:06:12.846 --> 00:06:14.410
to spice up your
core drawer panel.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.201
And after that, we're
going to start wiring

00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:17.650
this up with some real content.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.450
So as always,
thanks for watching.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.480
I'll see you next time.
