ROB DODSON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:01.959
What's up?

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.370
It's Rob Dodson here, from
the Google Developer Relations

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.880
team.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.755
And in this series we're
going to be covering

00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:10.180
the basics of using
Polymer's core-icon elements.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.620
In lesson 1, we'll
look at how you

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.224
can use core-icon to get your
very first image up on screen.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:16.640
And in lesson 2,
we'll look at how

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.160
you can load in a custom
icon set of your own making.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.640
But let's start
with Lesson 1, how

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.100
to get your very first
icon up on screen.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.660
So just about every
website is going

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.230
to need to use
icons at some point.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.938
So you know, looking
at the Polymer site,

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:31.325
we've got the Search icon here.

00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:33.202
We've got a few
buttons with icons.

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:34.660
We've even got some
of these arrows

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.794
down here that include it.

00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:37.460
And so, what we're
going to do today is,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.040
we're going to look at how you
can use the core-icon element

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.150
to get a single
icon up on screen,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.660
maybe something like a letter.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.090
And how you could use maybe
the core-icon elements

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.960
set to load in a
default set of icons.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.360
That'll make it
just a lot faster

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.990
for you to get some icons
displaying on screen.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.270
So, starting us off,
let's first look at how

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.260
we can get a core-icon
up on screen.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.218
So here, I'm assuming
it's in bower_components.

00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:04.060
And I've just imported
its definition.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.600
And once I drop my
core-icon on the page,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.540
I can give it a source attribute
and point to some image file

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.790
that I've got saved somewhere.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.470
So here I'm loading
this Android icon.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.410
But I could refer to just about
any image format that I want.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.360
It doesn't have to
necessarily be SVG.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.180
It could be like a png, a gif,
webp-- something like that.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.450
But typically we prefer, and
we recommend, that you use SVG.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.810
Primarily because
it's a vector format.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.750
Which means, it's not going
to lose any quality as you're

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.867
scaling the image up
or scaling it down.

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:38.450
Now, you might look
at this and think,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.290
it's not really a
significant improvement

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.290
over using something
like the image tag.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.150
We've still got to refer to
some source attribute, that's

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.960
some file that we've
got saved on disk.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.070
And that doesn't really
save us that much time.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.560
So to make things
easier on us, we

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.325
can actually include a
default icon set and pull

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:55.630
our icons from there.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.110
So let's take a look at that.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.970
So here I'm including
core-icons, instead of

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.154
just the core-icon element.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:01.820
Note the s here.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.440
This is plural.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.940
And what that's
doing is, it's going

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.856
to still load in the
definition for core-icon,

00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:09.550
but it's also going to
pull in a default icon set.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.040
So now you can just say,
hey, I want an icon.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.530
I want it to be an Android icon.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.710
And it's going to load that
from my default icon set.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.430
There's a bunch of
icons in the set.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.780
So I could throw
in a Cloud icon.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.000
I could throw in a Polymer icon.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.652
In fact, if you want to take a
look at the full suite of icons

00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:27.860
that are in the default set,
you can follow this link

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.760
right here.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.040
That'll take you to this page.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.539
There's tons of
great stuff that you

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.100
can look at and throw into
your site or application.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.600
All right.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.120
Now we've got something
showing up on screen.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.578
The next thing we
have got to do is

00:02:37.578 --> 00:02:39.850
we've got to give it some
size and we've got to style.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.380
So, I'm going to just
apply some CSS classes here

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.130
to change the size of my icon.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.340
And that's so I can
override the CSS that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.920
gives the icon its default
sizing of 24 pixels.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.120
So this icon, smaller
class, for instance,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.040
has a width and
height of 20 pixels.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.900
That's going to give me this guy
down here, who's much smaller.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.980
Likewise, using icon-larger,
width and height 90 pixels

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.560
gives me a much larger icon.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.810
And now to style this
thing, it's super simple.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.410
We're just going
to give it a color,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.130
using the color property in CSS.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.820
Set it equal to this
bright green value.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.090
And we'll get this guy
over here on the right.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.680
So that about covers the basics
of getting our core-icon up

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.612
on screen.

00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:19.320
Let's switch over to
our Code Editor now,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.694
and we can actually
see if we can

00:03:20.694 --> 00:03:22.625
get this to display
in our browser.

00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:24.500
All right, so the first
thing we needed to do

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.300
is we need to make sure
we're loading the platform.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.855
So we're going to pull
in bower_components

00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:28.813
/platforms/platform.js.

00:03:32.204 --> 00:03:34.620
That's going to give us access
to all of the web component

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.511
technologies, so we can start
using things like HTML imports.

00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:39.510
So then we're just going
to write out an import.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.980
And we're going to pull in
that core-icons definition.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.680
So we're going to say
core-icons-- core-icons.html.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.135
Note reason core-icons--
the plural one here.

00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:50.760
Because that's going to give us
access to the default icon set.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.220
And it's also going to load in
the definition for core-icon

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.250
for us.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.190
So then we can just
write out a core-icon tag

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.710
and give it an icon attribute.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.390
And we'll point it
at that Android icon

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.180
that we've been using so far.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.250
Save this.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.830
And go to our browser,
and refresh the page.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.360
And up there in the
top left corner,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.634
we've got a little bitty icon.

00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:10.050
So the next thing
I want to do is,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.970
I want to give this icon a size.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.940
So I'm going to start to
write out a style tag.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.070
And I've got to
remember, I've got

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.470
to add a class to
my icon elements.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.740
I'm going to go down there.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.380
And we'll give it a
class of icon-larger .

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.760
So our CSS has
greater specificity.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.770
So we're going to use
that icon-larger class.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.990
And we'll set the width
and height to 200 pixels.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.010
It's kind of a big icon.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.968
But that way, everyone
on the video can see it.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.600
So go back and refresh the page.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.892
And we've got this
much bigger icon.

00:04:43.892 --> 00:04:46.100
Now if you go and check out
the Polymer documentation

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.730
for the core-icon
element, you can actually

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.006
scroll down the page.

00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:51.880
And you'll see that
there is a link down here

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.760
at the bottom, which will point
to the core-icons element set.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.360
So you can actually
browse through all

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.770
of the icons that are
available in this default set.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.790
So scrolling around, I can see
that there's this cool Cloud

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.480
icon.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.380
And if I want, I can
just copy its name.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.714
Go back to my Code Editor, paste
that into my icon attribute.

00:05:12.714 --> 00:05:14.130
Then when I refresh
the page, I've

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.580
got this cooler Cloud
icon that I can work with.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.540
And going back, if I want, maybe
I can grab this Drive icon.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.620
Drop that into my icon
attribute, refresh the page,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.640
and I've got the Drive logo.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.379
Sweet.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.170
But I want to stick
with that Android icon,

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.500
because we've been working
with it for a bit now.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.259
So I'm going to put
Android back in there.

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.800
And the last thing I want to do
is I want to give it a color.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.480
So over my CSS, I'm just
going to use a color property.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.350
And I'm going to set it to this
cool bright green hex value.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.740
So save that, go back
and refresh the page.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.820
And I've got this bright
green Android icon.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.090
So that about covers
the basics of using

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.157
the core-icon elements.

00:05:56.157 --> 00:05:57.740
In the next video,
we're going to look

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.780
at how you can load in
additional icon sets,

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.090
including icon sets that
you create yourself.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.290
Thanks for watching.
