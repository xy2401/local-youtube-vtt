ROB DODSON: Hey everyone!

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.550
What's up?

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.310
It's Rob Dodson here,
and in this episode,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.434
I'm going to show you how
you can beef up your core

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:08.290
icons by loading in
additional icon sets.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.730
I'm also going to show you
how you create your own custom

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.850
icon sets using SVG.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.690
So let's check it out.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.520
So we're going to start
by building our own icon

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.572
set from scratch.

00:00:18.572 --> 00:00:20.030
That will show off
all the concepts

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.529
that we want to
cover in this video.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.410
So we're going to be using
the core-iconset-svg element.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.820
And keep in mind, there's
also a core-iconset element

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.140
that's primarily for
generating raster icon sets.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.980
We're going to focus
on the SVG version

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.770
because it looks
nicer, and tends

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.500
to scale better on
different screens.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
Now this is the first icon that
we're going to be producing,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.540
and we're going to give
it the name fancy-circles.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.560
And it's not
actually that fancy,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.620
it's just a few
overlapping circles,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.810
but it'll be a good starting
point for our icon set.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.226
The first thing
we've got to do is

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:54.310
we need to import the definition
for our core-iconset-svg

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.900
element.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.240
So over here, I've got bower
components/core iconset SVG,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.900
and that's going to actually
load in this tag over here,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.884
so I can start using
it in my application.

00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:06.300
And the next thing
I want to do is

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.591
I want to configure this thing.

00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:10.200
So I've got to give
it an ID, and this ID

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.020
is really important,
because this is actually

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.360
the name of my icon set.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.874
This is how people are going
to refer to my icon set later

00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:19.790
on when they want to
pull something out of it.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.410
So we're calling
it custom-icons.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.620
And if we want, we can also
give it an optional icon size.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.180
Here, I'm setting it to
50, which means 50 pixels.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.540
By default, all the icons
coming out of our set

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.210
would be 24 pixels, but
setting this icon size

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.790
is going to boost
that up for us.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.290
Again, it's optional,
you don't have

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.346
to include it if
you don't want to.

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:45.330
Now I'm going to open
my icon set tag up,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.400
and I'm going to drop some
SVG markup inside of here.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.590
And this is actually
the SVG code

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.200
that's going to generate
those circles for us.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.090
The thing to note
here is that we also

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.940
need to give this an
ID, and this is actually

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.550
the name of our icon.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.300
So when someone wants
to use this icon,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.139
they're going to ask
for the icon set,

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:05.930
and then they're going
to ask for the icon.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.305
I'll show you an
example of that.

00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:09.470
So here I've got a
core-icon element.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.494
The icon attribute's
totally empty.

00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:12.910
So we're going to
ask for the icon

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.400
set, which was custom-icons.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.530
We'll ask for the icon,
which is fancy-circles.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.470
We'll separate them
with a little colon,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.090
and now our icon is
showing up on screen.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.450
But it doesn't quite look
like what we imagined, right?

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.320
It's all one color, so
it's kind of boring.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.700
But this is actually one of
the cooler aspects of SVG.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.620
Because under the hood
everything is markup,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.230
we can actually go in and target
the different SVG elements,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.010
and style them individually.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.829
So let me show you
how that works.

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.370
So here's my icon
over here, and I've

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.650
got a style element on the left.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.010
And what I'm going to do
is start writing selectors

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.910
to target the bits of the
icon that I want to colorize.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.780
So I'll start with
this top circle,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.370
and move my way down all
the way to the bottom.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.360
So I can go in and style the
individual parts if I want.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.840
If you remember
in the last video,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.410
we showed how you can use
the color property to give

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.550
an icon a uniform color
all the way across.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.350
You can still do that with
this icon if you want,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.060
but SVG allows you a
little bit more control

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.210
if you need it,
which is pretty cool.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.710
All right, so now
you've gone ahead.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.409
You've made your first icon set,
you know how all that works.

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:18.950
The next thing I
want to do is I want

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.640
to take somebody else's icon
set and load it into my project.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.450
Now, if you recall
in the last video,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.020
I showed you this
link, which goes

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.602
to the documentation for the
core icon default icon set.

00:03:31.602 --> 00:03:33.060
But if you scroll
around that page,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.550
you'll see that there's
actually a whole bunch

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.780
of other stuff on here.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.950
There's other icon sets.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.770
There's AV icons for
audiovisual, maps, hardware.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.480
So if you want to load an
icon from one of those sets,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.440
the cool thing is that it
works exactly the same way

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.810
as the custom icon set
we were just showing.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.740
So I'll give you
an example here.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.400
Let's say I want to load in this
play icon from the AV icon set.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.510
So I'm going to import the
definition for those icons.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.560
So I'm going to ask for
core-icons, av-icons,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.820
and then I can just use the AV
icon in my core icon elements.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.410
I'm going to say I want an
av icon, colon, play-arrow,

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.880
and that's going to give me
this icon right over here.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.050
Super simple.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.541
All right, so now you know how
to create your own icon set.

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.040
You know how to take an icon
set that somebody else has made

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.272
for you, and actually
load it into your project.

00:04:27.272 --> 00:04:28.980
Let's switch over to
our code editor now,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.880
and we're actually
going to get some

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.370
of this showing up on screen.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.270
All right, so here
we've got a project

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.975
that's all set up
and ready to go.

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:37.600
And the first thing we're going
to want to do is create a brand

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.130
new file called
custom-icons.html.

00:04:41.394 --> 00:04:42.810
This is actually
where we're going

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.242
to put the definition for
the icon that we write.

00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:47.700
Now that we've got
this file ready,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.270
we can just import
the definition

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.150
for the core-iconset-svg
element.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.300
So I'm assuming it's
in bower_components,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.675
and I'm pulling
core-iconset-svg.

00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:00.610
And now that that's
ready, I can actually

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.490
just use the icon set tag on
my page, so core-iconset-svg.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.930
And we're going to configure it.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.290
We're going to make
sure to give it the ID,

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.760
so our icon set has a name.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.780
So we're going to
call it custom-icons.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.730
And we'll also throw in the
iconSize attribute as well.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.240
We'll set it equal to 50.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.952
Now remember, this iconSize
attribute is optional,

00:05:22.952 --> 00:05:24.160
you don't have to include it.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.100
I'm just throwing it
in here for funsies,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.530
so you guys can see it.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.570
So I'm just going to
go down and actually

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.350
paste in the code, the
SVG code, for my icon.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.550
And you'll see here
that I've got that ID.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.812
So my icon has a name
of fancy-circles.

00:05:39.812 --> 00:05:42.270
And at this point my icon set
is basically complete, right?

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.120
It's an icon set of one,
there's only one icon in it.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.980
But that's cool, we'll see
what we can get showing up.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.584
So over in my
index file, there's

00:05:49.584 --> 00:05:50.750
a few things I've got to do.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.900
I've got to make sure
to pull in the platform,

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.483
so I'm going to pull in bower
components/platform/platform.js.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.347
I'm going to import in the
definition for the core icon

00:06:02.347 --> 00:06:04.180
elements, so I can
actually display my icon.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.580
And I'm going to
import the definition

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.630
for this custom-icons
file that I just created.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.930
So now my icon set is available.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.540
And then in my body tag, I'll
just throw in a core-icon.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.310
And I'm going to set
the icon attribute

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.830
equal to custom-icons,
and put a colon in there,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.380
and then fancy-circles.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.230
If I save this, hop over to my
browser, and refresh the page,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.320
up there in the corner
you'll see a little icon.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.540
And I'm going to boost this up,
so you can see it a bit easier.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.980
There's our fancy-circles
ready to go.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.550
Now if you recall,
we gotta go in,

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.340
and we gotta add some style to
it, so it looks like we expect.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.390
So I'm going to add
a style element.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.950
And again, I'm just going
to paste in the CSS here,

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.255
so you guys don't have to
watch me type it all out.

00:06:54.255 --> 00:06:55.630
Now that's in,
and I'm just going

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.540
to clean up the
formatting a little bit.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.600
So we save this,
refresh the page,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.080
and now our icon's
showing up as we expected.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.090
Now what's really
cool is we can go in

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.560
and we can change these fill
colors to whatever we want.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.922
So we can set this equal
to red, green, blue.

00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:13.880
And it's not going to be
the best looking icon,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.750
but it will sort of demonstrate
the point that we really

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.660
can go in and target
different parts of our icon,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.230
and change the appearance,
which is really handy.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.240
So I've shown you how to
load in your custom icon.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.720
Let's go back and
clean that up a little.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.410
Now let's actually load an icon
from one of the additional sets

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.200
that come with the
core-icons package.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.570
So I'm going to, up
here in my imports area,

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:45.140
I'm going to import the
definition for the AV icon set.

00:07:48.142 --> 00:07:49.850
So I'm assuming it's
in bower_components,

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.766
I'm going to ask for
core-icons/av-icons.html.

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:59.490
If you want, if you actually
open your Bower components

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.440
folder and open the
core-icons package,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.990
you can see all the different
icon sets that are in here.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.690
So there's AV icons,
communication, device,

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:07.390
hardware.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.389
Lots of cool stuff in
there to play around with.

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:12.790
And it's really as easy as
just importing the definition.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.057
So down here my body tag, I'm
going to add another core-icon.

00:08:17.057 --> 00:08:19.390
And this time, I'm going to
set the icon attribute equal

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:25.070
to av:play-arrow, and that's
going to give me the play arrow

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.800
from the AV set.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.140
Refresh my page, and now I've
got this black icon up here.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.980
If I want to style it,
and give it some color,

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.210
I can maybe give it a class
name, or something like that.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.030
So I'll say the class
is equal to icon-play.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.270
And then in my CSS, I'll
just style off of that class.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.840
And say, hey, icon-play should
have a color of light green,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.444
or something.

00:08:49.444 --> 00:08:51.110
Just to show that you
can go in, and you

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.980
can style an entire
icon one color.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.685
Cool, awesome.

00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:56.060
Now one thing
that's really neat,

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.810
which we haven't
touched on before,

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.830
is to point out the
fact that there's

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.230
a bunch of different
elements in the core elements

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.020
set that support
icon attributes.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.910
So I'm actually going to import
the definition for a core icon

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.450
button.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.616
This is something that we
haven't actually seen yet,

00:09:11.616 --> 00:09:12.830
but it's really handy.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.190
So I'll pull in a
core icon button,

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.740
and then I'm just going
to use its icon attribute

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.860
to load in one of
these AV icons.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.200
So I'm asking for
a core-icon-button,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.930
I'm going to set its icon
equal to av:play-arrow,

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.380
swap back over to the
browser, refresh the page,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.220
and if I sort of adjust the
size down on our browser window,

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.760
now we've got this
really cool play button.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.840
Super simple.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.130
All right, so you're now
officially a core icon master.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.945
You know how to
create icon sets,

00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:47.870
you know how to load icon sets
that other people have made

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.226
for you, and you know how
to style all it using CSS.

00:09:51.226 --> 00:09:53.350
That means it's your turn
to go out there and start

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:54.960
creating some really awesome.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.780
Thanks for watching.
