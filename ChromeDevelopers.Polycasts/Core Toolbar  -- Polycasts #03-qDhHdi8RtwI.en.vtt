ROB DODSON: Hey,
everyone, what's up?

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.070
It's Rob Dodson here, from
the Google Developer Relations

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.380
Team.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.880
And in this video,
we're going to be

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.610
looking at the
core-toolbar element.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.300
Now, I personally
think core-toolbar

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.550
is one of the coolest elements
out there, because it's

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.400
really handy, and it's
very easy to master.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.660
So let's take a look.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.370
So the core-toolbar is
a really basic container

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.660
for laying out controls,
like tabs or buttons.

00:00:20.814 --> 00:00:22.980
So what I'm doing here is
I've got a toolbar element

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.420
on my page.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.289
And I've just put a div
inside of it that says My App.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.830
And that's going to
give me the title

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.640
of my application up
here on the top left.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.970
Now, if I want, I can
nest additional items

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.340
inside of here.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.400
I could include a
core-icon button.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.089
Maybe give it an icon menu.

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.130
And that's going to give
me this little hamburger

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.432
menu that you see up here.

00:00:42.432 --> 00:00:44.390
But the other cool thing
that's going to happen

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.450
is the toolbar is
smart enough to know

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.300
to just scoot my
title out of the way.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.640
It'll just move it over
there horizontally,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.140
and I don't need to write any
CSS to make this happen, which

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.860
is pretty handy.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.620
Now, the toolbar also comes
with some built-in stylings.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.020
For instance, if you give
it a class of medium-tall,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.465
you can see that it gets
just a little bit bigger.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.950
And if we give it a class of
tall, it'll get even larger.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.680
All right.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.180
Now, there's some
really cool things

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.580
that we can do with these
larger toolbars, so let's hop

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.375
into our terminal.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:16.592
We'll actually install
everything using Bower,

00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:18.300
and we'll use our Code
Editor to show off

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.716
some of these
additional features.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.020
So over in our
terminal, we're going

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.950
to use Bower to install
the core-toolbar.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.470
So I'll type bower install.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.652
I'll pass the Save flag,
which is really important,

00:01:28.652 --> 00:01:30.110
so that way, these
dependencies get

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.805
written to in my
Bower JSON file.

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:33.805
Then, I'm going to ask
for Polymer/core-toolbar.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.772
I'll ask for
Polymer/paper-icon-button,

00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:39.230
which we haven't
touched on before,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.220
but we'll be demonstrating
in this video.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.770
I'm also going to ask for
the paper-progress element,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.104
another cool element that
we're going to show off today.

00:01:46.104 --> 00:01:47.561
So that's going to
go out and fetch

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:49.010
all these different
dependencies.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.210
And once that's loaded, we can
switch over to our Code Editor.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.400
So over here, we've
got the basics

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.595
of an application ready to go.

00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:58.470
And the first thing
we're going to need to do

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.980
is we're going to
include the platform.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.700
And that way, we can
use web components

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.990
in browsers that lack support.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.198
So I'll say, bower_components
/platforms/platform.js.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.820
Now that that's in
place, I can go ahead

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.510
and import the definition
for our core-toolbar.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.317
So, I'll say
bower_components/core-toobar,

00:02:16.317 --> 00:02:17.400
ask for core-toolbar.html.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.310
And then I can hop
down to my body tag,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.345
and drop a core-toolbar element
right there on the page.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.580
And inside, we'll just
nest a little div,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.955
and we'll say My App for the
title of our application.

00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:35.790
Now, some of you
may have noticed

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.970
this fullbleed
attribute and wondered,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.840
what's this all about?

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.100
Well, that's actually one
of our layout attributes.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.474
And what it's
going to do is it's

00:02:43.474 --> 00:02:47.780
going to make sure that the
browser, that the body tag

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.670
within it, doesn't have any
white space around the outside.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.480
So our toolbar is
going to go right up

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.880
to the edge of the screen
and look really nice.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.720
So refresh the page, and
what we're going to see

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.000
is our toolbar showing up.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.890
And it's going
right up to the edge

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.610
of the browser,
which is really cool.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.990
And right now, it's kind
of this drab grey color.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.860
It's not super
exciting to look at.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.710
So we can change that by
going back into our Editor.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.170
And we'll just drop
in a style sheet.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.630
So I'm going to pop open
the sidebar in Sublime,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.740
create a new file.

00:03:22.024 --> 00:03:23.940
And I'm just going to
call this thing app.css.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.090
And over in app.css, I'll write
a style for the core-toolbar.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.800
So I'll ask for a core-toolbar.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.280
Set the background color
equal to-- actually,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280
I've got one saved here.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.371
I'll just drop that in.

00:03:37.371 --> 00:03:39.745
And then we'll set the color
equal to white for the text.

00:03:40.924 --> 00:03:42.340
And back in our
index file, we got

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.006
to make sure to include
that style sheet

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:45.380
so our styles actually show up.

00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:50.180
Now when we go and
refresh the browser,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.971
we've got a slightly
nicer looking toolbar.

00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:54.494
It's got kind of a cool color
to it and some white text.

00:03:54.494 --> 00:03:56.660
But it's still missing
controls, so you can't really

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.606
do much with it.

00:03:57.606 --> 00:03:58.480
So let's change that.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.560
We'll go back to our Editor.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.010
And we're going to import
some more definitions here.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.509
We're going to
import the definition

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.435
for that paper-icon-button
that we installed earlier.

00:04:07.435 --> 00:04:09.810
Now we haven't really talked
about the paper-icon-button.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.740
But we did show the
core-icon-button

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.130
in one of the previous videos.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.880
And you can think of
the paper-icon-button

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.339
as being basically the same
as the core-icon-button,

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.290
but it's just got a little
bit more pizazz to it.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.900
So I'm also going to be
sure to load the definition

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.780
for the core-icons elements set.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.761
This will just give
me the default icons

00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:28.760
that I can start working
with, and dropping them

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.843
into my paper-icon-button.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.370
And then down in
my toolbar, I'll

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.620
include the paper-icon-button.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.730
And I'll configure its icon
attribute, and I'll say,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.720
I want a menu icon.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.190
So now when I
refresh the page, I

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.200
get this little hamburger
menu over on the left.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.739
And when I click on it, you this
the sort of splashy ink effect.

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:56.030
That's the cool pizazz that
I was talking about before.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.970
Now, I want another icon, so
I'll just duplicate this line

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.710
here, and I'll
add a search icon.

00:05:02.526 --> 00:05:04.650
And we go back and refresh
the page in our browser,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.590
now we've got this magnifying
glass over here as well.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.680
But the problem is the layout
is not exactly what I want.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.370
I kind of what the
Search icon to appear

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.291
like somewhere over here,
over on the right-hand side

00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:17.040
of my application.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.350
So in our Editor,
what I'm going to do

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.955
is I'm just going to give
the div a flex attribute.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.990
And because the toolbar
is using flexbox

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.448
to lay out its
children, you'll see

00:05:28.448 --> 00:05:31.009
that now, our magnifying
glass moves all the way over

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.550
to the right-hand
side of the screen.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.450
The title is kind of
pushing it over there.

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.010
Well, that's really
cool, but there's

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.630
a slight problem
to this approach.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.950
If we open the DevTools, and
we actually inspect the My App

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.480
element, you can
see that it sort

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.420
of spans this entire distance.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.060
And if I made My App a clickable
link or something like that,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.200
then this whole area in
here would be clickable,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.300
and we don't really want that.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.910
So what we're going to do is
instead of putting the flex

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.630
attribute on My App, we'll
just drop in a span tag,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.410
and we'll put the flex
attribute on that.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.243
And this is kind of a
little bit of a trick,

00:06:05.243 --> 00:06:06.354
but it's pretty handy.

00:06:06.354 --> 00:06:07.770
And now when we
open the DevTools,

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.430
you'll see that
My App is only as

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.940
big as the content inside of it.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.960
And that span tag is
basically shimming the space

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.900
between the title of our app
and that magnifying glass.

00:06:19.924 --> 00:06:22.340
All right, so if you recall
at the beginning of the video,

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.214
I said that there's some
really cool features

00:06:24.214 --> 00:06:26.449
that we get from working
with larger toolbars.

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:27.990
Now that our toolbars
are showing up,

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.750
we've got some controls
inside of them,

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.610
we're going to actually
explore those awesome features.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.420
Let's check it out.

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.880
So over in our Code Editor, the
first thing we're going to do

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.370
is we're going to add a tall
class to our core-toolbar.

00:06:40.572 --> 00:06:43.120
And that's going to give us
that much larger toolbar that we

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.070
showed earlier in the slides.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.210
So save this and go
and refresh the page.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.480
And now, we've got this
much larger toolbar

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.790
that we can work with.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.050
And now that we've
got a bigger toolbar,

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.549
the interesting
thing that we can do

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:55.820
is we can actually start
pinning these child elements

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.880
to different locations
within the toolbar.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.480
So if you look at
our Code Editor,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.390
I'm going to hop
down to this div tag,

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.227
and I'm just going to
give it a class of bottom.

00:07:06.227 --> 00:07:08.060
And what that's going
to do is it's actually

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.950
going to jump My App down to
the bottom of the toolbar.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.380
It's pretty nice.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.130
Now, there's a few
other built-in classes.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.230
If I want, I can pop
back into my editor,

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.620
and bump it up to the
middle of the toolbar.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.320
Save that and
refresh the page, We

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.544
can also indent the
title if we want,

00:07:26.544 --> 00:07:28.210
just sort of scoot
it over a little bit.

00:07:30.302 --> 00:07:32.260
Now, the other interesting
thing that we can do

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.630
is we can actually fit an
item right to the bottom

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.542
without any sort of margin
or padding or anything.

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:40.750
You can imagine loading
something like a progress bar

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:41.260
down there.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.420
And in fact, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.250
So hop back into my
Code Editor, and I'm

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.410
going to import the definition
for that paper-progress element

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.470
that we installed before.

00:07:51.887 --> 00:07:54.470
Now, paper-progress is basically
just a really simple progress

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:54.970
bar.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.844
I'm going to clean this
up just a little bit,

00:07:56.844 --> 00:07:58.500
so the import looks a bit nicer.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.610
And then down here
in my core-toolbar,

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.560
I'll drop in the
paper-progress element.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.300
I'll give it a class.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.450
We're going to use the
bottom class, which

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.680
you saw before to move it
to the bottom of the screen.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.760
Then we'll give
it another class.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.190
We'll add a fit
class, and that's

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.705
going to remove any
margin or padding

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:17.705
from the toolbar itself.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.210
We'll also give
it a value of 30,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.852
so that you can see that it's
kind of partially filled up.

00:08:22.852 --> 00:08:24.310
And now, when I
refresh the screen,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.200
you'll see that I've got this
sort of green toolbar here,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.580
and you've kind of got this gray
area where it's not filled in.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.860
So that's one way that
you could add a progress

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.276
bar to your application.

00:08:34.276 --> 00:08:36.400
And you could imagine
updating that value attribute

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.858
using something like JavaScript,
so you see this thing kind

00:08:38.858 --> 00:08:40.809
of animating and
zipping along as content

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:42.250
is loading into the page.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.730
So that about covers
everything you

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.170
need to know to work
with the core-toolbar.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.080
It's not a very complex
element, and that's

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.720
kind of the beauty of it.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.460
Once you've mastered
it, you can just

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.460
reach for it out of your
toolbox, the same way

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.134
that you pull out
div, paragraph, table.

00:08:57.134 --> 00:08:58.800
In the next video,
I'm going to show you

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.520
how you can incorporate
the core-toolbar

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.425
with some other
scaffolding elements,

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:03.800
and we're going
to begin to build

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.930
what look like the beginnings
of mobile applications.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.080
So stay tuned for that.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.890
Hope to see you there.
