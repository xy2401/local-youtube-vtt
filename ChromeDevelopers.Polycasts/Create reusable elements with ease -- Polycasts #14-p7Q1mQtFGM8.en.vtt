00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.766
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.406
Hey, everyone.

00:00:03.406 --> 00:00:03.906
What's up?

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:04.770
It's Rob Dodson.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.561
Today on "Polycasts,"
I'm going to show you

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:09.000
a very important technique
for writing reusable elements.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.724
Plus, I've got a boatload of
Polymer goodies to give away.

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:13.390
But you're going to
have to stick around

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.098
till the end of the
episode to figure out

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.650
how to get your hands on those.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.090
So first thing's first.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.600
Let's talk reusable components.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.100
All right.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.040
And what I'm going
to talk about today

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.790
is a very important
technique that applies

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.169
to both Polymer 0.8 and 0.5.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.710
It's one of those things that
I see most beginners get wrong,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.010
because frankly, it's
just really confusing.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.460
So let me give you a scenario.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.050
Let's say we have
a folder structure.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.290
We're creating an
element that we

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.540
want to share with some folks.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.290
And this is the look
of our project so far.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.259
So we've got tiny-badge.html.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:43.050
This is the tag that
we're going to create.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.070
And then inside of here,
we've got our bower_components

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.700
directory.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.240
And inside of there,
we've got polymer.html.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.582
Now, if I open the definition
for tiny-badge.html,

00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:53.040
you'll see up here at the top,
the first thing I'm doing is

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.330
I'm importing polymer.html.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.650
And I'm importing it from that
bower_components directory.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.660
So I'm basically hard-coding
the path bower_components

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.390
in my elements definition.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.610
Let's say I'm happy with
the look of tiny-badge.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.026
I want to share
it with the world.

00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:08.700
So I publish it to
the Bower registry.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.920
I tell everyone how cool
it is, and all my friends

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.960
go and install it.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.240
Let's look at what their
project looks like, OK?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.250
My buddy installed tiny-badge.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.360
It ends up inside of his
bower_components directory.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.490
So now they've got
polymer and tiny-badge

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.600
as siblings in their
bower_components directory.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.710
But wait a sec.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.800
If I open the definition
for tiny-badge.html,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.990
you'll recall that I've got
this hard-coded bower_components

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.130
path in here.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.645
So this element is
expecting a sibling,

00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:37.770
bower_components directory.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.140
It's expecting something to
exist right at this level.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.080
But it doesn't, right?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.127
We're inside of our friend's
bower_components structure,

00:01:45.127 --> 00:01:46.710
because they installed
our components.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.000
So this path right here is
going to give us a big, fat 404.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.390
And our friend is going
to be super bummed out.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.771
Now, we can change this.

00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:56.770
We can totally fix this.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.840
We can just change this
path to a relative path.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.720
And we sometimes refer to this
as using the canonical path.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.840
The idea here is that, if
you're using a front-end package

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.470
manager, all of your packages
are going to be siblings.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.070
And so if you just use a
dot-dot-slash relative path,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.600
you're basically
saying, hey, I'm

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.220
referring to something that
is in one of my sibling

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.910
directories.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.590
So that's why we
call it canonical,

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.680
because you're always sort of
sibling to your dependencies.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.890
But hold on a second.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.030
Let's rewind a bit.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.975
This is our original
project structure.

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:31.850
This is how we were
developing our component.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.950
And the whole reason why
we had this hard-coded

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.530
bower_components
path was because we

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.530
needed to be able to
preview this thing while we

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.290
worked on it.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.240
If we change this to
a canonical path here,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.520
then we can't
preview our element.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.760
So now we're in this
really crappy dilemma

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.610
of either being able to preview
our component as we're working

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.140
on it or being able
to actually share it

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.460
with people once it's finished.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.384
And this is really not
a great dilemma to have.

00:02:54.384 --> 00:02:56.050
So last year, we put
together an article

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.790
which explained a really clever
directory structure plus Bower

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.660
configuration hack you could
use to develop and preview

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.980
a sharable element.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.647
What I'm about to
show you is a new tool

00:03:05.647 --> 00:03:07.271
created by a member
of the Polymer team

00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:08.830
which removes a lot
of this craziness

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.460
and lets you develop your
element in a very sane fashion.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.670
So let's check that out.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.030
So this is the element that
we're going to be creating.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.200
Again, it's this sort
of tiny-badge element.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.750
You could imagine it's
something you might toss inline

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.030
into a project, like a list
or something like that,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.020
to let someone know
they've got some emails

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.160
or some alerts piling up.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.826
And the first thing I'm going to
do is create a bower.json file.

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:30.490
I'm going to give
my element a name.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.281
And I'm going to include
some dependencies.

00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:34.590
So I'm asking for
webcomponentsjs and polymer.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.230
Over in my terminal,
I'm going to run

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.442
bower install to pull down
all of those dependencies.

00:03:40.442 --> 00:03:42.150
The next thing I'm
going to do is install

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.580
a library called polyserve.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.340
So I'm using the npm command.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.990
I'm doing a global install
to pull down polyserve.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.650
And what polyserve
is is basically

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.350
a server that is going to let
you write your element using

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.930
canonical path URLs.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.260
It then intercepts those
URLs, and it serves them

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.210
from your local
bower_components directory.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.420
It was created by a
member of the Polymer team

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.650
to try and work around this
dilemma of not being able

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.590
to preview and share
the same component.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.540
So I'm going to boot up
the polyserve server.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.399
And you'll see here that
it started on port 8080,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.170
and it's serving
tiny-badge from the path

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.711
localhost:8080/components/tiny
badge.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.920
And over in my
project, I'm going

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.730
to create a
tiny-badge HTML file.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.188
And the first thing
I'm going to do

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:33.930
is import the
definition for Polymer.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.470
And you'll note that I'm going
to use the canonical path when

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.560
I do this.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.480
Then I'm going to
give my tiny-badge

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.500
a don-module with
an ID that matches

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.842
the name that I'm registering.

00:04:43.842 --> 00:04:46.300
I'm going to throw a content
element inside of the template

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.799
there.

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:49.250
And lastly, I'm going to
call the Polymer constructor

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.080
and pass in the tiny-badge name.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.960
I'm also going to
include a style tag.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.640
And this is just to give my
tiny-badge a little bit of look

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.270
and feel.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.490
You'll see that I'm
using that host selector

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.780
from the previous episodes.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.810
So that way, I can target
the element itself.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.280
Over in my demo HTML file, I'm
going to start off by including

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.590
a script tag for
webcomponents-lite.js.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.240
And then I'm going
to include an HTML

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.820
import for my tiny-badge
element definition.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.990
Lastly, I'm going to
include a style tag.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.720
And I'm just going to use a
nicer font family on the page,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.330
so the badge looks
a little nicer.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.310
And then down in my body,
I'm going to create a list.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.610
And inside this
list, I will drop

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.470
in a tiny-badge element
in line there so that we

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.720
can create a fake inbox.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.020
Now, if I go over to Chrome
and preview everything,

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.249
you can see that I've got
the tiny-badge showing up.

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.040
If you look at the URL
that I'm using here,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.365
it's
localhost:8080/components/tiny

00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:46.031
badge/demo.html.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.060
And the nice thing is that I'm
able to develop this component.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.380
I'm able to preview it.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.740
But I've written
its dependencies

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.640
using canonical path URLs.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.810
So this component is also ready
to be published to the Bower

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.440
registry.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.455
It's ready to be shared
with the whole world.

00:06:04.455 --> 00:06:05.330
So there you have it.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.199
Developing Polymer elements
just got way simpler.

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.240
Now, normally, this is
the part where I sign off,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.710
and I tell you to
subscribe to the channel.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.070
But today I've got a very
special announcement.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.037
We've got a whole bunch of
just killer Polymer swag

00:06:18.037 --> 00:06:20.370
that we want to give away to
a few of you lucky viewers.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.209
So here is how this
is going to work.

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:24.500
You leave questions about
Polymer down in the comments.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.090
And each time we shoot a new
episode, I'm going to go back,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.131
pick some of the best
questions to answer on air.

00:06:29.131 --> 00:06:31.590
And if your question gets
picked, you get some swag.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.130
We got hoodies, stickers, toys,
laptop skins-- you name it.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.110
If you want an autographed photo
of me with a corgi or a walrus,

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.080
we can do that.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.319
So get your thinking caps on.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.610
Drop me a line in the comments.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.360
As always, thank you
so much for watching.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.542
And I'll see you next time.

00:06:46.542 --> 00:06:47.250
Hey, Polycasters.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.280
It's Rob here, letting
you know I've got a brand

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.446
new show called "LazyWeb."

00:06:50.446 --> 00:06:52.320

from last week's news

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.416
on the web bundled up for
your viewing pleasure.

00:06:54.416 --> 00:06:56.570
