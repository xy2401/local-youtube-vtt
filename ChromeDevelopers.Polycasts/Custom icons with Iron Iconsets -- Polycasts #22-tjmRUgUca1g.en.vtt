00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:04.940
Hey, everyone what's up.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.400
It's Rob Dodson.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.941
Today on Polycasts,
I'm going to take

00:00:06.941 --> 00:00:09.990
a look at building icon sets
with the new iron iconset

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.900
elements.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.370
Also going to show you a
very useful performance tip,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.930
so be sure to stick
around for that.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.850
Now, without further
ado, let's get hacking.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.910
OK, so in this episode,
we're going back in time.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.840
We're updating the old
episode on core-iconset-svg,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.750
and now we're going to be
using the new iron-iconset-svg

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.490
element.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.940
So looking at our code
from the last episode,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.850
the changes are going
to be pretty minimal.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.250
So any place where you
see core-iconset-svg,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.745
we would just replace that with
iron-iconset-svg including down

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.170
in the tag name here.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.410
And in the old episode,
and with the old element,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.250
you would use an ID to
reference your icon set.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.340
That has been updated.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.525
So now in the 1.0
version, you use name

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.670
to reference your icon
set that you're creating.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.600
And iconSize, that has just
been simplified to size.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.030
So over here, you
can see in my editor,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.530
I've got the icon
set that I created

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.530
in the original episode.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.910
It looks pretty much the same.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.020
We've got the
iron-iconset element

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.190
with our SVG inside of it.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.970
And we've still got our
fancy-circles icon here.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.910
Note that the icon itself
still uses an ID, while you

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.315
use a name for the icon set.

00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:14.607
Now, over here in my
project, again this

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.190
looks very similar
to the old episode.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.620
I've updated the polyfills
to webcomponents-lite.js.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.470
I'm using iron-icons
now and av-icons

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.360
instead of the old core icons.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.050
I'm using a paper-icon-button.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.700
And then lastly here I'm
importing my icon set

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.930
that I've created.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.330
And then down here, the
syntax to use an icon

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.180
is still the same.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.940
You prefix it with
your icon set name

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.960
with a colon and then
the name of your icon.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.840
And here I'm using an AV
icon from a different set.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.964
So you see I use its name.

00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:45.130
And lastly, for icons coming
out of the default set,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.987
you can just use
their regular name.

00:01:46.987 --> 00:01:48.570
You don't have to
prefix anything that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.980
comes from the iron-icons set.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.870
So if I go to my
browser and I run this,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.710
everything is going to
look and work exactly

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.610
like it did in the old
episode, which is really great.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.820
But I want to show you
this very, very important

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.974
performance trick because it
could shave off maybe hundreds

00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:06.140
of kilobytes from your site.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.880
So what I'm going to do
is pop open the dev tools,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.600
and I'm going to filter
it to just look for files

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.260
with the name icons in it.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.430
And when I refresh the
page, what you'll see here,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.970
I've got the
iron-icons that loaded,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.170
I've got the
av-icons that loaded,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.770
and I've got the custom-icons
set that loaded as well.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.730
Now, check out the file
size for these icon sets.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.390
You can see that iron-icons
is like 59 KB, which

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.280
is pretty big, the av-icons is
15 KB, and then my icon set,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.710
that one little icon that I
created was 2.2 kilobytes.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.700
So I'm only using like one
icon from each set, which

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.280
means I'm incurring
like what, about 70

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.819
KB of additional weight
for just two icons,

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:54.860
which is pretty wasteful.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.970
And you could imagine if
you were pulling icons

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.880
from two, three, four
additional icon sets,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.980
this would really
start to add up.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.490
So what I want to do
is take these two icons

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.230
and just dump them into my
custom-icons set to really cut

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.805
down on the overhead.

00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:12.600
So to do that, I'm going
to go back into my project.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.660
And I'm going to just open
up the av-icons set to start.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.960
I'm going to find the play
arrow that's inside of here.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.650
And again, it's just
one big SVG file,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.140
so I just find that
element and I drop it

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.060
into my custom-icons set right
after that fancy-circles icon.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.840
Go to the iron-icons set,
and I find that android icon.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.400
Again, just sort
of copy and paste

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.660
this right out of
the original icon

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.630
set into my smaller,
more refined set.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.070
And now I've got my
custom icon set going.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.220
I can hop open into
my original project

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.210
and get rid of the AV icons
and get rid of the iron

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.060
icons because I don't
need the whole set.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.940
I'm just going to load the
iron icon element, right?

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.740
So I can actually use the icons.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.198
And I'm going to go down, and
I'm going to update the name.

00:03:55.198 --> 00:03:57.705
So any place where
it said AV icons,

00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:59.090
I'll change it to custom icons.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.410
Where it said android, I'll
change that custom icons.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.740
And now when I go back to my
project and I refresh the page,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.210
you'll see that all my
icons continue to load,

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.520
but check out the file size.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.750
Now it's just 8K
down from around,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.959
you know, what was that?

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.286
Like 70K.

00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:20.410
So this is a really, really,
really important trick

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.118
for you to learn.

00:04:21.118 --> 00:04:24.970
It's wonderful to develop
with these icon sets.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.800
I really enjoy it.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.970
It makes it very convenient.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.810
But when it's time
to go to production,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.610
you've got to make
sure that you're

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.100
trimming these things down.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.880
You don't have excess
icons that you're

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.240
loading that are just going
to slow down the user's

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.620
initial load experience.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.960
So hope this tip helps
you build slightly more

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.600
performant applications.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.600
So that about covers it.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.460
You now know how to work with
1.0 iron iconset SVG elements,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.660
and your site
should be a smaller

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.599
thanks to that little
trick that I showed you.

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:53.890
That's it for this week, folks.
