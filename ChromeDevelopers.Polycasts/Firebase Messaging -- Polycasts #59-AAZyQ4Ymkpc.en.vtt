ROB DODSON: Hey,
everybody, what's up?

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:06.760
It's Rob Dodson.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.330
Welcome back to the show.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.060
So today, we're going
to be continuing

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.130
our series on
Polymer and Firebase

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.785
by using the Firebase
Messaging element.

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:18.040
So that allows us to add push
notifications to our Polymer

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.030
plus Firebase app.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.270
So to get started with
Firebase Messaging,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.790
follow me over
here to my laptop.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.550
And I've gone to
beta.webcomponents.org.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.610
This is our amazing new
web components catalog.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.780
And I just went ahead and
looked for Firebase Messaging.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.379
That'll take me to
the Polymerfire repo.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.170
And once you're here,
you want to make sure

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.753
to go over to the
side bar here, where

00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:42.250
I lists all of the elements
that fall under Polymerfire,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.750
and click on Firebase Messaging.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.960
Now we can see the docs
specific to this element.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.480
So there's a few things
that we need to do to get up

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.190
and running with
Firebase Messaging.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.110
And I often forget these steps.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.660
So I'm going to try
and do them first

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.930
so I don't forget this time.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.060
The first one we want
to do is go down here

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.060
to where it says that we
need a web app manifest.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.880
And we need this gcm_sender_id.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.940
So there is a specific number
that it has listed here--

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.060
like 10395-- whatever,
whatever, whatever.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.370
We have to use that exact
number in our web app manifest,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.190
because that is the
sender ID for, I think,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.350
Google Cloud Messaging
Service or whatever, which

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.050
is what we have to use to
send push notifications using

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.740
Firebase.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.110
So I am going to go over
to Visual Studio Code.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.110
I've got this project
that I've already started.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.170
I'm going to create a new
file called manifest.json.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.907
And inside of here, I'm going
to paste just that one key.

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:33.240
You might already have a
manifest.json for your project.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.810
You might already have a few
other things inside of there.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.860
That's cool.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.780
Just make sure that you
include this one key

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.940
somewhere in your manifest.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.840
And then over in
my index file, I'm

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.600
just going to write a link tag.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.720
And the rel is going
to be manifest.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.030
And the href is going
to be manifest.json.

00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:53.350
Just like that.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.766
The next thing we
need to do is we

00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:58.960
need to get some magical keys
from our Firebase project.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.940
I'm going to go over
to my Firebase console.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.440
This is my project that
I've already set up.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.030
And I can click on this little
gear here, my project settings.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.244
And there's a tab right
here for Cloud Messaging.

00:02:09.244 --> 00:02:10.660
So I'll bump that
up a little bit.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.160
It's just a little
easier to see.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.375
So there's a couple
keys on this page.

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:17.500
I'm going to just go ahead
and take this server key

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.360
and copy that to my
clipboard, because I'm

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.770
going to need that later.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.000
And I also need this sender ID.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.080
So this is my
Firebase-specific sender ID.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.000
This one is specific
to my project.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.980
So it's different from
that gcm_sender_id

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.490
that we were just working with.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.135
So I am going to copy this
one, go back to my project,

00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:37.420
and I'm going to find my
Firebase app element, which

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.410
is somewhere in here.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.340
Here we go.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.990
And I believe we need to
make sure to add to this one

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.736
messagingsender-id and set it
to that Firebase-specific key

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:50.110
that we just copied
out of there.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.170
OK, we've got that part set up.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.210
Now, we're ready to actually
start adding Firebase Messaging

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.110
to our project.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.300
We're going to get back to the
server key a little bit later.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.740
But now we're actually
ready to start dropping

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.823
some of these elements in.

00:03:00.823 --> 00:03:02.864
So I go back to the
docs for Polymerfire.

00:03:02.864 --> 00:03:04.780
And what's really nice
is the sample code here

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.380
is pretty good.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.150
So we can just sort
of follow it directly.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.690
So I want to grab this Firebase
Messaging element right here.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.294
Just copy that code.

00:03:12.294 --> 00:03:13.960
And what I'm going
to build is basically

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.347
like a little toggle switch.

00:03:15.347 --> 00:03:16.930
So I'm going to hit
the toggle switch.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.810
It'll ask them for permission
to send them notifications.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.020
They'll say, yes.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.190
It'll take that token that's
generated by that permission

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.860
grant.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.500
It'll save that to Firebase.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.109
And it will also
give us an indicator

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.400
that we can then go ahead
and send them a notification.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.070
And then we're going to do
that using some cURL magic.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.680
To create that element,
I'm going to, in my public

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.653
directory, just make a new file
called my-subscription.html.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.200
And I'm going to just start
out by importing a few Firebase

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.210
elements that we need.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.920
We know that we're
going to need--

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.378
so we'll do this
from Polymerfire--

00:03:49.378 --> 00:03:52.000
we're going to
need firebase-auth.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.370
We're going to need
firebase-document.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.250
We're going to need
firebase-messaging.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.920
And one more element
that we're going to need

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.600
is a paper toggle button.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.730
So I haven't installed
that yet, but I

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.580
will in just a second--
so paper-toggle-button.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.080
Right?

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.730
Switch over to the terminal.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.493
So we'll do bower install
save PolymerElements/paper

00:04:16.493 --> 00:04:20.274
toggle button.

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:21.440
So I'll go out and fetch it.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.273
I've already got it
installed in my project.

00:04:23.273 --> 00:04:24.670
So it should be good to go.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.715
Switching back over to
the subscription element

00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:29.215
that we were writing,
I'm just going

00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:32.230
to use the little code snippet
here to stub things out.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.000
So I'll say my-subscription.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.500
Cool.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.704
So in our template, we
can now just start copy

00:04:37.704 --> 00:04:39.370
and pasting some of
the code that we saw

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.140
in the Firebase Messaging docs.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.840
So I'll just drop in the
Firebase Messaging element

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.478
right here.

00:04:45.478 --> 00:04:46.450
There we go.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.440
All right, so what
this is going to do

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.120
is it's going to
create an element that

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.740
has an ID of messaging.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.535
We'll use that later to
access it in JavaScript.

00:04:53.535 --> 00:04:55.660
It's going to have a token
attribute, which is just

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.930
going to expose to the
rest of the elements

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.030
inside of this thing
that we're building.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.250
And then when it
receives a message,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.852
it's going to try and call this
handleMessage method, which

00:05:05.852 --> 00:05:07.310
we'll implement a
little bit later.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.143
The other thing we need
to do is just verify

00:05:09.143 --> 00:05:10.050
that we have a user.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.180
So I'm going to just drop
in a firebase-auth element.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.311
Paste this puppy in there.

00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:14.810
Cool.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.590
Cool.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.209
All right, so we used this
in the past two episodes.

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:20.000
We're kind of treating
firebase-auth almost

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.760
like a model representing
the state of the user.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.120
And in this case, we just want
to get that user value out

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.100
of firebase-auth.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.730
So once the user
has signed in, we

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.030
can use that value to then
write to specific parts

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.110
of that user's database.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.485
In this case, we
are going to use

00:05:34.485 --> 00:05:37.970
it to save the token that
Firebase Messaging generates

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.300
when the user grants
it permission.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.970
So to do that, we will drop
in a firebase-document.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:44.970
Past this puppy in here.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.428
All right, so what we're going
to do with this document is,

00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:50.090
the firebase-document works
very similar to firebase-query,

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.890
which I think we used
in the last episode.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.740
Firebase-query you use to
write to the Firebase database

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.630
when you're working
with array-like data--

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.170
so a big collection of
things like the to-do's

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.470
in our to-do list.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.970
Firebase-document
is useful when you

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.760
want to write to a
very specific object.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.190
So we're not pushing a
bunch of array-like data.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.620
We're just writing a
specific value to some field.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.120
So in this case,
we're going to say,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.080
we want to write
to /users/user_uid.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.787
So this will be specific to
the user that's signed in.

00:06:17.787 --> 00:06:19.995
And we're going to give them
this token sub-property,

00:06:19.995 --> 00:06:22.460
and we're going to
write to that field.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.770
The data that will
fulfill that value

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.680
is going to come from this
one-way token binding, which

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.132
will be generated by
Firebase Messaging.

00:06:30.132 --> 00:06:32.090
So basically, what we're
doing is we're saying,

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.215
when the user grants Firebase
Messaging permission,

00:06:34.215 --> 00:06:36.173
it's going to generate
a token, and we're going

00:06:36.173 --> 00:06:37.440
to save that to the database.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.140
And that's really useful,
because in the future when

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.964
you want to send
somebody a notification,

00:06:40.964 --> 00:06:42.380
you are going to
check to see, OK,

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.280
is this user-- have they
approved the permission

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.750
to send notifications?

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.960
Yes or no?

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.940
Do we have a token?

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.300
If so, let's use that to then
send them that notification.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.000
All right, I want to set
up a little bit of code

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.150
to actually ask the user
for permission here.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.610
And this is we're going to
use that paper-toggle-button.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.056
So I've just got a little bit
that I will paste in here.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.930
All right, so we've got
a paper-toggle-button

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.370
with an ID of Subscribe, and
whenever the user taps it,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.537
we're going to call this
toggle-subscription-method.

00:07:11.537 --> 00:07:12.953
And then we're
going to figure out

00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:15.110
whether this thing should
be checked or not checked

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.900
based on if the user has
already generated a token.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.760
This is a quick and
dirty way to do things.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.260
I would actually
probably recommend,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.900
if you're building like
more of a production app,

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.750
you have a separate property
where you're keeping track of

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.767
whether or not the
user is subscribed.

00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:31.100
But in this case, since we
just want to get something up

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.410
and running, we can
use this approach.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.750
And then underneath where
the paper-toggle-button asked

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.460
the user to subscribe,
I'm actually

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.830
just going to create a
couple paragraph tags to log

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.934
the value of the token.

00:07:40.934 --> 00:07:42.350
And we're going
to need that later

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.616
on when we use cURL to
actually send a notification.

00:07:45.616 --> 00:07:47.990
But normally, you would just
store this in your database,

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.650
and you would work
with it server side.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.233
But in our case,
we're going to use it

00:07:51.233 --> 00:07:53.600
so we can cURL against it.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.330
So I need to implement this
toggle-subscription method

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.300
so that the user can do the
whole permission auth grant

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.230
thing.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.560
So if we go over and we
look at the documentation

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.930
for Polymerfire, they've
actually given us basically

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.570
all the code that we're going
to need to stub out there.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.404
We're just going copy
this chunk right here.

00:08:10.404 --> 00:08:12.153
And I'll walk you
through what's happening

00:08:12.153 --> 00:08:13.070
after we implement it.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.620
So we'll say
toggle-subscription is function.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.810
And we'll paste that in.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.040
All right, so what
is happening here?

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.745
So we're saying, all right,
find this .$.messaging.

00:08:26.745 --> 00:08:29.120
So again, that's Polymer's
way of referring to an element

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.090
by its ID.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.390
So this is referring to our
Firebase Messaging element

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.720
right here.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.330
So we're saying
take that element.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.095
Call its request
permission method.

00:08:37.095 --> 00:08:38.720
That's going to then
ask the user, hey,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.700
is it cool to send
you notifications?

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.470
And it's going to
return a promise.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.570
And if that promise
fulfills, then we

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.340
know that permission
was granted.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.770
If that promise fails
for whatever reason,

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.780
then we know that
permission was denied.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.250
This is also a good place, for
instance, if you wanted to,

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.840
you could differentiate the user
is subscribed or not subscribed

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.560
and store a separate value
in your database just

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.829
like a flag is
subscribed or not.

00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:03.620
You could do that inside
of these handlers.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.300
But in our case, we're just
going to prompt the user.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.560
And once they say yes, then our
Firebase Messaging element--

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.950
it will get a token
just sort of magically.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.570
That's how its internals work.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.830
That will fulfill to this
firebase-document element.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.410
So it'll write it
to our database,

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.535
and we'll actually be able
to go check the database

00:09:20.535 --> 00:09:22.680
to verify that everything
is working as expected.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.440
The last thing that
I want to do here

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.240
is implement this
handleMessage method.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.430
So this is going to
run whenever we receive

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.059
a notification from the server.

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:32.600
So in our case,
because we're working

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.558
kind of quick and dirty,
I'm actually not going

00:09:34.558 --> 00:09:35.840
to do very much with this.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.042
What you could normally
do is display like a toast

00:09:38.042 --> 00:09:40.250
or some sort of notification
like on the desktop site

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.130
to the user.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.820
But I am just going
to console-log

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.560
that a message was received.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.490
And we will just log
out the arguments,

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.250
which should give us
like a data object

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.339
showing us the content
of that notification.

00:09:54.339 --> 00:09:55.880
And the cool thing,
though, is if you

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.670
are on a mobile device
like mobile Chrome,

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.530
this notification,
as it came in,

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.192
would just show up in the user's
system tray automatically.

00:10:03.192 --> 00:10:04.900
You don't even really
need to do any code

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.880
to make that happen,
which is pretty awesome.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.760
The last thing, actually,
that we need to do

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.980
is we need to create
a service worker that

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.660
can work with Firebase
Messaging and receive those push

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.740
notifications, even if
the user is not currently

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.140
looking at this application
as their active tab.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.780
So if we go and we look
at our documentation,

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:27.460
it tells us that we should have
a firebase-messaging.swjs file.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.000
So I'll create that new file.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.880
And the contents of
that file are linked to

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.180
from these FCM documentations.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.692
Here we go.

00:10:38.692 --> 00:10:40.150
I've copied this
code from earlier.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.566
But basically,
what we're doing is

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:44.400
we're importing the Firebase
App JavaScript file.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.390
We're importing Firebase
Messaging JavaScript.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.455
We need both of these
little libraries

00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:50.080
so that our service
worker can properly

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.030
work with Firebase services.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.910
And then we just call this
one method-- initialize-app.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.500
We give it our
message-sender ID,

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.260
which, if you remember, we
copied out of our project

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.820
console earlier.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.610
And then we just have this
messaging property where we're

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.320
just saying firebase.messaging.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.440
That just kicks things off
and gets things running.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.720
I think, at this point,
we might be good to go

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.690
and actually ready
to test this thing.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.160
Fingers crossed that this
works on the first try.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.280
So I'm going to
run Firebase Serve.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.330
That'll start up a
little local project.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.610
So I'll go over to
our project here.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.074
All right, refresh the page.

00:11:26.074 --> 00:11:26.573
Cool.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.140
Let's see.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.681
I think we're missing
something here.

00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:34.260
Oh.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.790
It is helpful if we include
the subscription element

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.350
in the rest of our project.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.090
So go back to my app--
make sure that we

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:46.270
have imported my
subscription-- my-subscription.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.820
Man, I'm totally-- I know I'm
not spelling this thing right

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.320
somewhere.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.130
But I'm going to power
on and see what happens.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.120
So I'll drop in
my-subscription element.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.710
Right?

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.290
OK, refresh the page.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:56.950
Yes.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.610
OK, we have a
paper-toggle-button here.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.430
So the user clicks
the check box.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.680
It asks them, hey, can
I get your permission?

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.570
We say, yeah.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.222
And that's going to give us
this big, elaborate token.

00:12:07.222 --> 00:12:08.680
Remember, if we go
back and we look

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.570
at the my-subscription
element, when

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.700
the user receives
their token, I'm

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.080
like writing it to the page.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.630
So we can use it to cURL.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.280
So I'm going to copy
all this text here.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.230
And it runs off
to the side there.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.780
So grab all of that.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.410
There we go.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.120
Get all of that.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.072
And let's see.

00:12:26.072 --> 00:12:27.530
If we look in our
Firebase console,

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.290
we can actually
see in the database

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.375
that our user has
been established.

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:34.000
They have a token
that has been written

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.290
to the database for them,
which is kind of nice.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.900
And so the last
thing I'm going to do

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.480
is I'm just going to
use cURL to simulate

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.860
sending this user a message.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.810
Now, normally,
you would probably

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.827
do this work on your server
side based on some user action.

00:12:48.827 --> 00:12:51.160
But we're just going to do
it here from our console just

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.990
to test that everything works.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.384
And I've saved already
this notification file,

00:12:55.384 --> 00:12:56.800
because there's a
fair bit of code

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.745
that we have to write
to make this work.

00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:01.120
And I'm going to post all this
code on GitHub afterwards.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.710
So you don't have
to memorize all this

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.120
or copy it down by hand.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.920
But we're going to use cURL.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.394
And we're going to-- here
I'll close this sidebar

00:13:08.394 --> 00:13:09.810
and make this a
little bit easier.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:10.570
OK.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.170
So we're going to use cURL.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.690
We're going to pass a header
with our authorization key.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.330
So remember earlier,
I grabbed two keys out

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.470
of my Firebase console.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.730
I'll go back so
you can see here.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.970
So let's see, we go to
our project settings.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.329
We go to cloud messaging.

00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:24.370
So there's two keys here.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.050
There is this really
long server key,

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.820
and there was our sender ID.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.430
So I need this really
long server key.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.170
And I'm going to pass that
as my authorization key

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.810
in this cURL header.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.345
So that is this first part here.

00:13:36.345 --> 00:13:40.100
It's super long, super
long, it goes on forever.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:40.600
There we go.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.267
So we need that.

00:13:41.267 --> 00:13:43.308
Then we have another header
for the content-type.

00:13:43.308 --> 00:13:45.380
We are just going to say
it's application/json

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.680
and pass the -d flag
to tell it we're

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.874
going to pass it some data.

00:13:48.874 --> 00:13:50.540
And the data that
we're sending-- sorry,

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.890
this is a little hard to read.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.510
But the data that we're sending
is an object with a 2 value.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.780
And the 2 value is going
to be our user's token.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.750
So that really, really
long string here.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.347
So that helps identify their
device, if I recall correctly.

00:14:05.347 --> 00:14:06.930
So we're going to
make sure that we're

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.220
sending it to the right device.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.380
So go all the way to the end.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.647
Paste in that token, right?

00:14:13.647 --> 00:14:14.730
Double check that's right.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.697
Yep.

00:14:15.697 --> 00:14:17.530
And then we send them
a notification object.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.750
So this can have a title field.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.310
We'll just say hello world.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.320
And a body object-- we'll just
say this is a notification.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.790
And the last piece that we
pass is this address to FCM.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.850
So we're going to
grab all of this.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.890
We're going to go
to our console--

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.307
have a new tab here--
paste that in, run it.

00:14:36.307 --> 00:14:38.890
So we should get something that
looks like this where it says,

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.380
success 1, so far, so good.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.810
Go back to our project.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.130
You can see here in our
terminal now-- here,

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.310
I'll boost this up so it's
really clear that we've

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.109
got a "message received."

00:14:50.109 --> 00:14:52.150
So remember, we were
console logging our message.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.717
The message has been received.

00:14:53.717 --> 00:14:56.175
And we're going to look at the
object, look at the message,

00:14:56.175 --> 00:14:57.700
look at the
notification, and we can

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.220
see there is the content
for our notification.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.470
So, yeah, if you want to
tell your user like, hey, you

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.060
won some amazing contest, you
won 1,000 free inflatable ducks

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.820
you can do that
using that object.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.330
So that is the basics of
setting up notifications

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.830
using Polymerfire.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.530
Again, it's a fair
number of steps,

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.050
but honestly, compared to
doing all this yourself

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.910
in JavaScript, this is a much
much, much easier approach.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.880
So I highly recommend
everyone try it out.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.320
If you have any questions
about what we did today,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.690
as always, you can leave them
for me down in the comments.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.064

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.100
As always, thanks so
much for watching.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.264
