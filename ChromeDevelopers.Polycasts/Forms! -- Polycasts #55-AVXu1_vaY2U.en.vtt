MONICA DINCULESCU:
Hey Polycasters!

00:00:06.546 --> 00:00:07.920
And welcome to a
surprise edition

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.822
of "The Meowni.ca Show."

00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:11.280
I thought I should
steal the camera

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.613
from Rob for a little bit so
I can tell you about forms.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:15.390
That's the thing that
I'm excited about.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.120
Forms are really
awesome because you

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.490
get to send data that a
user types into a server

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.620
without doing any work
or writing any JavaScript

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.560
and that's great.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.030
But if you've noticed,
forms don't really

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.870
work with custom elements that
you may have been writing.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.570
Because forms only care about
the native input element.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.430
So in Polymer we try
to fix that by making

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.170
something called an iron-form.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.665
Iron-form is really great if
you get to control the custom

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:36.090
element that you're
writing, because you need

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.006
to do a little bit of
work so that it actually

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:39.207
talks to an iron-form.

00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:40.790
So what I want to
do today is show you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.590
how you can get a native form to
actually care about your custom

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.960
element with just
doing one little trick.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.030
And that is to basically copy
a value into a hidden input

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.650
element so that the
form actually sees it.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.430
Come to my computer, here.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.290
So the first thing I want
to do is create a form.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.830
And you'll notice here that I'm
using something called httpbin.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.420
Httpbin is an awesome
service that basically

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.300
lets you send a request to it,
and it responds with the thing

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.116
that you sent.

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:07.990
This is really awesome
because I don't really

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.490
want to write a server
to make this demo.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.950
Nobody does.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.730
So whatever I send
to httpbin is going

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.020
to tell me the arguments and
the headers and the stuff.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.700
They're great.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.930
So I've created a form.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.830
And I have some form styles here
included, so that it actually

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.110
looks pretty and not terrible.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.030
So you're impressed
with my mad CSS skills.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.310
And in this form I'm going to
put something called a birthday

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.870
input.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.270
The thing that I'm going to demo
is basically a custom element

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.910
that gets her birthdate
so that I can send you

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.630
cake when it's
actually your birthday.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.490
It's going to be
amazing for everyone.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.115
So I'm going to put
an input over here.

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:38.736
And I'm going to put a button.

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:40.110
It's got a class,
so it's pretty.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.730
And if we go over here to my
demo and I refresh my page,

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.590
I have a form.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.440
It has a button.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.350
Very exciting.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.490
So let's actually implement
this custom element.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.990
It's a birthday
input, so it's going

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.680
to have a label to tell
you what this input does.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.727
And then I'm going
to put a date input.

00:01:56.727 --> 00:01:58.560
That's really just two
text fields together.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.570
And one of them is a month,
and one of them is a date.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.100
So if I refresh my from here,
I should also import it.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.240
So I'm going to go ahead and
include my element in the demo.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.330
And then when I refresh it, bam.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.410
There is an input.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.990
The thing is, I didn't tell
the form to care about it.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.207
So if I actually try to
submit a date in here,

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:21.040
http doesn't see it.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.640
I didn't send any
arguments with that form.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.515
And that makes sense.

00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:24.810
We didn't do any of the magic.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.140
So let's go ahead and do it.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.080
So the first thing I
want to do is actually

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.769
assemble this birthday somehow.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.810
So I'm going to create a
property called birthday

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.602
on my input, which
is just a string.

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:37.810
And I'm going to get it from
the thing that you type.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.710
So I'm going to add an
event listener for input

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.543
so that every time you
type something in one

00:02:41.543 --> 00:02:43.217
of these fields, I get an event.

00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:45.050
In this event listener,
what I'm going to do

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.440
is just take the two values
and smash them together

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.690
with a slash.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.620
And they're going to go into
this property called birthday.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.240
Cool.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.090
So that's still not going to
work because I still didn't

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.310
tell the form how to use it.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.220
So let's do this.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.330
I'm going to have
my input element,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.867
and it has the birthday.

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:03.450
And I'm going to
bind it to a variable

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.070
so that I can actually
pass this variable to one

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.410
of my hidden inputs.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.520
So I'm going to create this
hidden element, it's an input,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.030
it's hidden.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.946
So that means it doesn't
show up in your form.

00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:14.387
Our form looks exactly the same.

00:03:14.387 --> 00:03:15.720
And I'm going to give it a name.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.330
Unless your input
has a name, the form

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.880
doesn't care about it either.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.220
And then its value is going to
be the value from the birthday

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.135
input element.

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:23.760
So that's cool.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.926
I've wired them up together.

00:03:24.926 --> 00:03:26.840
And for this to actually
work in our demo,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.910
you got to put them
inside a dumb bind.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.960
Sweet.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.990
All of this should work.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.230
Let's go and refresh our demo.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.770
It looks exactly the same.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.392
I'm going to put in my birthday.

00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:38.600
This is actually my birthday.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.680
Please send me presents.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.340
I will appreciate them greatly.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.010
And now when I
submit, look at this.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.580
We've sent something to httpbin.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.360
It confirms I've
sent it a birthdate.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.230
Everything is
working as expected.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.730
Amazing.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.105
And that's how you trick a
form to care about your custom

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:51.859
element.

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.150
Thank you so much for watching.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.108
