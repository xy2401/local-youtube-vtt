00:00:03.412 --> 00:00:04.370
Hey there, Polycasters.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.370
Rob here with a very special
announcement because today,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.479
we are moving.

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.270
Well, not today, because
you're watching us

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.430
on the Google
Developers channel,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.930
but the next episode
of "Polycast"

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.750
is going to be premiering
on our brand-new,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.997
revamped Chrome
Developers channel.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.830
That means you can
subscribe to that channel

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.490
and get notifications for
the kinds of shows you like,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.884
shows about the web.

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:25.300
Along with "Polycast,"
we're going

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.200
to be moving our
British counterparts,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.990
"HTTP 203" and
"Totally Tooling Tips."

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.220
As we create new shows, we'll be
premiering them on that channel

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.380
as well.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.260
So click this annotation
to check it out,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.150
tell your friends,
spread the word,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.200
and I'll see you on
Chrome Developers.
