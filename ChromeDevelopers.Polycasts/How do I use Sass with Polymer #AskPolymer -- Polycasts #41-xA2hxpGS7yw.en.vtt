FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE],
take two, marker.

00:00:04.512 --> 00:00:05.720
ROB DODSON: Hey, Polycasters.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.330
What's up?

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.000
Rob here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.240
Welcome back to another
episode of #AskPolymer.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.740
This is a little
segment that we do,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.970
where you send in
questions on G+ or Twitter,

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.020
and I do my best to answer them.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.150
OK, our first question comes
from Wheatley, who asks,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.190
is it possible to use
Sass with Polymer?

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.360
And if so, what's the best
way to go about doing that?

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.470
So there's are really
two things to think about

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.011
if you want to use
Sass with Polymer.

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:31.680
The first is that Sass needs
to know about Polymer's custom

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.470
property and CSS mixin syntax.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.700
The other is that, for
using external style sheets

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.200
or something like
that, you're going

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.230
to need to bundle everything
into a style module.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.950
Now, for that first point,
mixins and custom properties,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.670
there is a master bug in Sass
tracking support for this.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.020
So you can check that
out over here, right?

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.390
Recently, Sass added support
for custom properties.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.931
But if you want to
use mixins, you're

00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.200
going to need to escape
the mixin code using

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.550
a little bit of Sass syntax.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.890
As for wrapping things
in style modules,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.850
there's a tool that our
teammate Eric Bidelman

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.370
created called Polystyles.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.690
I will leave a link to that
down in the show notes.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.520
So you can use that with an
external CSS file, bundle

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.580
it all up into a style
module that Polymer

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.830
knows how to work with.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.970
And that way, you can use
Sass and style modules

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.180
in your application.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.480
So thank you, Wheatley,
for that question.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.470
So our next question comes
from George, who was wondering,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.470
do you recommend
putting every element

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.800
inside of your
elements.html file,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.930
or do you put your elements
inside of other elements?

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.430
So I'm assuming,
George, that you're

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.870
using the Polymer Starter Kit
application boilerplate thing.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.339
So that actually comes with
a little elements.html file,

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:43.380
where we put a whole bunch
of element definitions

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.410
that we end up importing
into our index file.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.170
So basically what
you want to do is,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.440
if you are creating
your own element,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.550
that element should
always list all the things

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.679
that it depends on as imports
at the top of its file.

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.220
So if you're creating an element
that depends on paper-button

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.344
or something like that,
the import for paper-button

00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:02.910
should be right at the top
of your elements definition.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.750
Now, if you're then using that
element in your index file,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.544
then, yeah, sure,
put that element

00:02:08.544 --> 00:02:10.169
that you just defined
in elements.html.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.150
HTML But you don't need to
put all of its dependencies

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.560
in elements.html as well.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.840
Really, you can think
of elements.html

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.310
as all the things that the index
file depends on, basically.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.080
So, yeah, elements, they
import their dependencies.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.140
Anything that you're
using in your index file,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.432
that can go into elements.html.

00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:29.390
Hope that sort of clears
things up a little bit

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.104
for you, George.

00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:31.520
All right, our
next question comes

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.470
from Jesse, who was
wondering, when are we going

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.350
to get a Datagrid in Polymer?

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.180
So that's a good question.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.020
Right now, the
Polymer team is not

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.144
planning to ship a
bunch of new elements.

00:02:43.144 --> 00:02:44.560
We're working on
a few things kind

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.685
of related to framework
stuff, like a router, stuff

00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:48.850
working with the URL.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.240
But we're not planning to ship
a bunch of new UI elements.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.950
Instead, I think
what we'd really

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.600
like to do in 2016 is
see more elements coming

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.000
from the community.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.670
And we want to do our best
to promote those elements,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.500
because there's a
lot of good stuff

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.124
that's being built
out there right now,

00:03:03.124 --> 00:03:05.040
but maybe everybody
doesn't know about it.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.665
If you aren't familiar
with it, there's

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:08.545
a website called
CustomElements.io.

00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:10.940
I will link to that over here.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.760
And this is basically
like-- it's kind

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.932
of like MPM for Web Components.

00:03:14.932 --> 00:03:15.640
You can go there.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.190
You can just start typing
in what you're looking for.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.565
And there's a bunch of things
that folks in the community

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.810
have just created
and published there.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.420
And so yeah, what
we'd like to do

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.040
is we'd like to promote some of
the data grids, some of the UI

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.470
components that are
out there already.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.655
There's one really good one
by a team called Vaadin.

00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:31.820
I think it's just called
Vaaid Datagrid, perhaps.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.590
You can find it on that website.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.750
And for those you out
there who are thinking

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.125
about building
some stuff, you're

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:40.080
thinking about sharing it,
share it on CustomElements.io,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.350
and then ping me on Twitter.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.010
And we can try and promote it
and get more people involved

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.020
in the ecosystem.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.910
So thank you, Jesse,
for that question.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.610
Our next question comes
from Zikes, who asks,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.880
what are the biggest
barriers to adoption today?

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.700
And what's on the horizon
to overcome those barriers?

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.420
So I think over the last
year, the hardest was just

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.260
making sure the components
work well across a browser

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.880
and that they were performant.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.660
I feel like we're
starting to get

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.370
to a really good place with
Polymer, where those things

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.859
have kind of settled down.

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.400
Where it's still
tough today, though,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.160
is taking a bunch of components
and knitting them together

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.550
into an application.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.087
We're sort of missing the
framework pieces, if you will.

00:04:20.087 --> 00:04:21.920
And so what we're going
to work on this year

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.310
is rolling out an
improved router.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.700
We're going to work on some
stuff around data bindings

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.660
and improve data flow through
your application, some design

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.690
patterns that you can use so you
can figure out how to architect

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.944
the whole thing together.

00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:35.360
And yeah, I think
right now that's

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.651
still probably the biggest
barrier and stuff that we're

00:04:37.651 --> 00:04:40.390
going to be tackling this year
and rolling out and hopefully

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.540
improving the story there.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.560
So thank you, Zikes,
for that question.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.920
OK, the last question
comes from Dan,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.540
who asks, how can
a developer using

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.400
Polymer contribute the most
to the Polymer project?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.600
So there's a couple
ways that I think

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.050
you can go about doing that.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.180
The first is go check
out some of our projects,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.040
like Polymer Starter
Kit, where we already

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.260
have a ton of active
community involvement.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.700
And look through
the issue tracker.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.250
Find a bug that looks like maybe
it's something you could work,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.626
maybe something nobody's
working on just yet.

00:05:11.626 --> 00:05:13.000
Leave a comment
and be like, hey,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.130
can I try and tackle this bug?

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.912
And once you do, send
us a pull request.

00:05:16.912 --> 00:05:18.370
And we'll even work
with you to try

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.411
and-- if you've never done
a pull request before,

00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:22.470
we'll work with you to
set that up and walk you

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.570
through the process.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.080
That stuff is super helpful.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.205
You can do that on Polymer.

00:05:26.205 --> 00:05:27.990
You can do that on the
element repos, too.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.436
If you find an element,
there's a bug in it,

00:05:30.436 --> 00:05:31.810
rather than just
filing an issue,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.070
see if you can get in
there and try and fix it.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.770
Also, if you're building stuff,
share it with the community.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.400
I mentioned earlier there's
this site, CustomElements.io.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.680
I'm going to leave the link
down in the show notes.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.320
But we're really trying
to get more people

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.050
building components,
more people sharing

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.340
them there so we can all
benefit from each other's work.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.540
So those are the two big
areas that I can think of.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.990
Pitch in on some
of these things.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.870
Send us a pull
request if you can.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.912
And also, share the stuff
that you're building.

00:05:57.912 --> 00:05:58.620
Get it out there.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.911
Get some other people using it.

00:05:59.911 --> 00:06:02.910
And that way, we can just
grow the whole ecosystem.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.180
So thank you, Dan, for
sending in that question.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.922
All right, so thank you for
all of those awesome questions.

00:06:07.922 --> 00:06:10.130
If you out there, if you
have some questions that you

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.004
want us to answer, just
leave them down below

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:12.800
in the comments.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.360
Or you can ping us on a social
network of your choosing

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.130
at #AskPolymer.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.880
As always, thank you
so much for watching.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.716
And I'll see you next time.

00:06:20.716 --> 00:06:22.820
So I think over the
past year or two,

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.740
where most people "struggerled"
was just getting-- what?

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.560
[BLEEP].

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.312
I know I said "struggerled."

00:06:29.312 --> 00:06:30.728
MALE SPEAKER: You
want some water?

00:06:30.728 --> 00:06:31.154
ROB DODSON: No, no, no.

00:06:31.154 --> 00:06:31.885
I'm fine.

00:06:31.885 --> 00:06:35.260
I just struggled as
I am struggling now.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.590
Words.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.696
They hard to speak.
