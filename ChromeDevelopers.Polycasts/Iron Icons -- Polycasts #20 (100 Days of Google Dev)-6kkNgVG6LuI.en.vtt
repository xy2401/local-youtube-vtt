[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.227 --> 00:00:05.810
Hey, everyone.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.190
What's up?

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.856
It's Rob Dodson.

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:09.970
Welcome to the very first
update episode of Polycast.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.040
In these videos, I'm
going to go back in time

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.810
and dig up some of
our older episodes

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.780
so I can update them with
all the Polymer 1.0 goodness.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.050
Today, we are starting
with Polycast numero

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.290
uno, which is on core-icons.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.950
So I'm going to
show you how to work

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.610
with the new iron-icon element.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.139
Let's take a look.

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:29.680
So today, I'm going to help you
convert the previous episode,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.810
which worked with the
core-icon element,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.020
to the updated iron-icon that
is now part of Polymer 1.0.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.480
Many of the elements that were
previously in the core set

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.940
have now been ported to either
the iron set or the paper set.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.650
And the general rule of thumb
that I like to keep in my head

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.250
is if the previous element
was mostly just behavior,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.200
then it has probably been
moved to the iron element set.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.020
If it had a bit of UI to it,
like perhaps the core toolbar

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.490
or the core header panel,
anything that's sort of visual,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.627
then it has been moved
to the paper element set.

00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:01.710
So we're going to be working
with iron-icon today.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.085
The first thing
we're going to do

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:06.270
is go over to the catalog at
elements.polymerproject.org

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.920
and go and click on
the Iron Elements set

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.330
to get the documentation.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.260
And I'll just find the docs
for the iron-icon element

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.977
inside of here.

00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:16.560
And you'll notice that if you've
watched the previous episode,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.460
a lot of these things
are the same from before.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.440
We've still got a
Source attribute

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.880
if you're working with sources.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240
If you are working
directly with an icon,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.530
there is still the
Icon attribute.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.730
So many of the
things are similar

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.100
from the previous video.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.510
The one thing that I do
want to point out here

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.640
is a little bit
further down the page.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.310
You'll see a section on styling.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.980
And this is going
to mention styling

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.465
using custom properties.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.590
Now, if you're not familiar
with custom properties,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.130
we covered those in
a previous episode.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.690
So if you go check
out this episode,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.910
it will explain how
custom properties work.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.560
I recommend you
go and watch that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.050
before watching the
rest of this episode

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.490
because we're going to
use these in a little bit.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.310
OK.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.580
Now, to install these
in my application,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.630
I'm going to hop over
into my terminal.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.700
And I will run
bower install, save.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.310
And you'll notice here that
I'm installing from Polymer

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.000
elements/iron-icons.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.030
All of the Polymer element
sets or whatever now

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.020
live in this Polymer
elements org on GitHub.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.520
So any time you're
bower installing,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.490
you're doing it from
Polymer elements.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.670
That's going to go out
and fetch the repo,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.920
download it to my application.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.800
So I'm ready to rock.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.840
Now if I open my
project up in Sublime,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.560
I've actually got the old
project from the old episode.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.000
And we're going to go
through and update this.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.512
So I open up my Bower
components directory.

00:02:39.512 --> 00:02:40.970
And you'll see that
inside of here,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.650
we've got both the iron-icon
element, as well as

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.320
the iron-icons element.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.260
So by installing iron-icons,
I got iron-icon for free

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.120
because it depends on it.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.670
Next, I'm going to open
my index HTML file.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.590
And scrolling down
here, I'm going

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.830
to replace the old polyfills.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.420
These are quite
old at this point.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.878
So we're going to update them
to use webcomponents-lite.js.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.310
That is the polyfill set
we use in Polymer 1.0.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.760
And then instead of
importing core-icons,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.600
we will import iron-icons.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.090
And that is going to import both
the default icon set, as well

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.290
as the iron-icon element.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.652
So I can use that default set.

00:03:21.652 --> 00:03:23.110
Now, the next thing
I want to do is

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.110
go down here to where
it says core-icon

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.780
and replace these with
my individual iron-icons.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.425
So I can just go and
delete all these.

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:33.800
We're going to
use the same icon.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.966
We'll use that android icon.

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:37.430
But this time, we'll use the
iron-icon element to do it.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.190
So iron-icon, icon
equals android, right?

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.400
Pretty straightforward.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.720
I can go boot up a local server.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.640
And then I'll zoom
in here, and you

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.560
can see that we've got our
Android icon displaying.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.270
So we're all good there.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.770
OK.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.720
So if you go to
the Element catalog

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.880
because you want to add
some additional icons

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.577
to your application and you want
to look up what they're called,

00:03:57.577 --> 00:03:59.160
logically, you're
going to go and look

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.010
for the iron-icons
element set docs.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.300
And what you're going
to find is a blank page

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.730
because there is a bug
in the catalog right now.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.817
So I know about this little
special URL, which is basically

00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:12.150
you take a demo file from
somewhere else in the catalog,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.710
and then you just replace
the URL with iron-icons.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.140
And that's actually
going to load

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.806
in the docs for your
iron-icons for you.

00:04:17.806 --> 00:04:18.950
It's a total hack.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.655
To make your life easier, I will
give you a little annotation

00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:23.490
here that you can click on.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.220
So this will take you
right to the icon docs.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.670
This is a bug that we
have open in the catalog.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.630
We're going to get
it fixed really soon.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.540
If you're watching
this in the future,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.500
maybe it's already fixed.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.917
But if you're
watching this today,

00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:36.125
and you want to read the
docs, click that annotation.

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:38.150
It'll save you a little
bit of a headache there.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.920
Now, once I hit that URL, I'm
going to see the full default

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.050
elements set.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.640
So this is everything that I
got in my iron-icons import.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.098
And if I scroll down, there
are actually other element sets

00:04:49.098 --> 00:04:51.900
as well that I could
use in my application.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.230
So here's one called AV
for audiovisual icons.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.950
And looking around, I can
see that this AV snooze

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.650
icon down here, right about
here, looks pretty neat.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.150
Right?

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.330
So maybe I want to use
that in my application.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.170
So I'll hop back
into my project.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.890
And you'll see that when I
open up the iron-icons set,

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.030
that inside of here, there's
a few different icon sets.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.850
There are the AV icons.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.600
So I just need to
import that element set.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.420
So I will drop an import after
where I pulled in iron icons.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.420
And here, I'm going
to import AV icons.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.360
Now all of those icons will
be available to me as well.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.330
So copy in my iron-icon and
drop in one that says av:snooze.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.457
And anytime you're using an
icon from a set that is not

00:05:33.457 --> 00:05:35.540
the default set, you're
going to need to prefix it

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.330
with the set name and a colon.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.180
Now when I hop back
into my editor,

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.940
you can see I've
got my Android icon,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.140
and I've got my AV snooze icon.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.100
Now, the last thing that I
want to do-- as you recall,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.270
we can style the elements
using these custom properties

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.550
for width and height.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.900
So I'm going to hop
back into my editor

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.192
and create a theme.html file.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.650
And inside of this file, I'm
going to create a custom style

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.150
property.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.480
So style is custom style.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.480
And I can treat this kind
of like a style sheet.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.070
So I'll target the
iron-icon element.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.486
And now I can target the custom
properties inside of this.

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:13.380
So I'm just going to
make all iron-icons have

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.640
a really big width and
height so that they're

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.350
visible from space, basically.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.720
So I've set width and height.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.990
I'm going to import
my theme file.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.520
And now when I go back to my
browser and refresh the page,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.970
I've got these ginormous icons.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.330
So again, it's kind of
absurd to make them this big.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.560
But this way, you can
globally set the size

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.760
for all of your iron-icons.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.724
Or if you wanted to
target it by class,

00:06:37.724 --> 00:06:39.140
you can do these
different things.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.886
And in this case, it's
not a very huge use

00:06:42.886 --> 00:06:43.760
of custom properties.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.430
But I want to get you familiar
with custom properties.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.170
I want to get you
comfortable using them

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.750
because we're going to be using
them a lot more in the future.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.680
So that about does it.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.880
You've now got the
latest and greatest info

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.329
on working with
icons in Polymer 1.0.

00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:57.620
That's it for this week, folks.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.010
As always, thank you
so much for watching.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.120
I'll see you next time.
