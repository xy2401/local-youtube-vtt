[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.227 --> 00:00:05.810
嘿 各位
Hey, everyone.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.190
大家好
What's up?

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.856
我是 Rob Doson
It's Rob Dodson.

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:09.970
欢迎收看 polycast 进阶教程系列的第一期
Welcome to the very first update episode of Polycast.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.040
在这系列的视频中  我将会回到
In these videos, I'm going to go back in time

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.810
以前的视频  并且深入挖掘一些及技巧
and dig up some of our older episodes

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.780
以便把它们升级成 Polymer 1.0 版相关内容
so I can update them with all the Polymer 1.0 goodness.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.050
今天  我们从 core-icons 上的
Today, we are starting with Polycast numero

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.290
Polycast 1.0 开始
uno, which is on core-icons.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.950
那么我将会给各位展示如何使用
So I'm going to show you how to work

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.610
全新的 iron-icon 元素
with the new iron-icon element.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.139
大家拭目以待
Let's take a look.

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:29.680
那么今天  我会帮助各位把之前的讲解视频中使用
So today, I'm going to help you convert the previous episode,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.810
core-icon 元素的技巧  转换成
which worked with the core-icon element,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.020
当今 Polymer 1.0 里全新模块的升级版 iron-icon 的使用办法
to the updated iron-icon that is now part of Polymer 1.0.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.480
许多之前在 core 设置中的元素
Many of the elements that were previously in the core set

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.940
如今已经被转移到了 iron 设置或者 paper 设置中
have now been ported to either the iron set or the paper set.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.650
我经常放在首位的通用经验法则是
And the general rule of thumb that I like to keep in my head

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.250
如果之前的元素大部分只是特性
is if the previous element was mostly just behavior,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.200
那么它们很可能就被转移到了 iron 元素集合中
then it has probably been moved to the iron element set.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.020
如果它有一些用户界面  比如 core 工具栏
If it had a bit of UI to it, like perhaps the core toolbar

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.490
或者是 core 头文件板  任何可视化的东西
or the core header panel, anything that's sort of visual,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.627
那么它就会被转移到 paper 集合中
then it has been moved to the paper element set.

00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:01.710
现在我们要使用 iron-icon
So we're going to be working with iron-icon today.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.085
首先我们要做的事情
The first thing we're going to do

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:06.270
就是浏览 elements.polymerproject.org 下的目录文件
is go over to the catalog at elements.polymerproject.org

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.920
然后继续点击 Iron Element 集合
and go and click on the Iron Elements set

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.330
来打开文件
to get the documentation.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.260
然后我就能在这里找到 iron-icon 
And I'll just find the docs for the iron-icon element

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.977
元素的文件了
inside of here.

00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:16.560
如果你看过之前的教学视频  也许你会注意到
And you'll notice that if you've watched the previous episode,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.460
这里的很多文件跟之前完全一样
a lot of these things are the same from before.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.440
如果你使用源文件
We've still got a Source attribute

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.880
那么我们依然能得到源属性
if you're working with sources.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240
而如果你直接对图标进行操作
If you are working directly with an icon,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.530
你得到的也是图标属性
there is still the Icon attribute.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.730
这与之前视频中相似的
So many of the things are similar

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.100
地方如此之多
from the previous video.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.510
我想在这里指出的一件事
The one thing that I do want to point out here

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.640
你可以在页面的下方看见它
is a little bit further down the page.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.310
你能看到样式的部分
You'll see a section on styling.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.980
这就提到了通过使用自定义属性
And this is going to mention styling

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.465
来设置风格样式
using custom properties.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.590
现在 也许你对自定义属性并不熟悉
Now, if you're not familiar with custom properties,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.130
我们在之前的一集视频中详细讲解了
we covered those in a previous episode.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.690
所以如果你回头温习一下
So if you go check out this episode,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.910
就能理解自定义属性是如何起作用的
it will explain how custom properties work.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.560
我的建议是在继续观看本期视频之前
I recommend you go and watch that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.050
先回头看看那一期
before watching the rest of this episode

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.490
因为我们在这里需要用到一些自定义属性
because we're going to use these in a little bit.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.310
好了
OK.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.580
现在  为了在我的应用中安装这些
Now, to install these in my application,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.630
我就跳过细节直到重点了
I'm going to hop over into my terminal.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.700
然后我运行 bower 安装  保存
And I will run bower install, save.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.310
你会注意到我也是从 Polymer elements / iron-icons
And you'll notice here that I'm installing from Polymer

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.000
目录安装的
elements/iron-icons.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.030
所有的 Polymer 元素设置及其相关内容
All of the Polymer element sets or whatever now

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.020
保存在了 GitHub 上的 Polymer elements org
live in this Polymer elements org on GitHub.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.520
所以无论何时  只要你在 bower 安装
So any time you're bower installing,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.490
你就在从 Polymer Elements 调用它
you're doing it from Polymer elements.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.670
这就会溢出并触发回收机制
That's going to go out and fetch the repo,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.920
并将之下载到我的应用中
download it to my application.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.800
那么我准备好进行下一步了
So I'm ready to rock.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.840
现在如果我在 Sublime 中打开工程
Now if I open my project up in Sublime,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.560
其实我打开的是之前视频中创建的老工程
I've actually got the old project from the old episode.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.000
然后我们来把它过一遍并且稍微升级一下
And we're going to go through and update this.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.512
我先打开 bower 组件目录
So I open up my Bower components directory.

00:02:39.512 --> 00:02:40.970
你能看到在目录里的这个位置
And you'll see that inside of here,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.650
我们不仅找到了 iron-icon 元素
we've got both the iron-icon element, as well as

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.320
而且找到了 iron-icons 元素
the iron-icons element.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.260
所以说借助安装 iron-icons 我也得到了免费的  iron-icon
So by installing iron-icons, I got iron-icon for free

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.120
这是因为前者运行依赖于后者
because it depends on it.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.670
接下来  我要打开 HTML 文件索引
Next, I'm going to open my index HTML file.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.590
然后页面向下滚动到这里
And scrolling down here, I'm going

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.830
我要替换原来的 polyfills
to replace the old polyfills.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.420
在这个节点上来说这些文件都是相当老旧了
These are quite old at this point.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.878
所以我们要将他们升级来使用 webcomponents-lite.js.
So we're going to update them to use webcomponents-lite.js.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.310
那就是我们在 polymer 1.0 中使用的 polyfi ll 集
That is the polyfill set we use in Polymer 1.0.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.760
然后接下来我们要导入的
And then instead of importing core-icons,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.600
并非是 iron-icons 而是 core-icons
we will import iron-icons.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.090
这就既会导入默认的图标集合
And that is going to import both the default icon set, as well

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.290
也能导入 iron-icon 元素
as the iron-icon element.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.652
所以我能使用默认的集合
So I can use that default set.

00:03:21.652 --> 00:03:23.110
现在 接下来我想做的事情就是
Now, the next thing I want to do is

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.110
页面下提到 core-icons 的这个位置
go down here to where it says core-icon

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.780
并将之替换为我个人的 iron-icons
and replace these with my individual iron-icons.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.425
那么我只需要继续删除所有的这些
So I can just go and delete all these.

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:33.800
我们要用到完全相同的图标
We're going to use the same icon.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.966
我们将用到那些安卓的图标
We'll use that android icon.

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:37.430
但是这次  我们将用到 iron-icon 元素来完成
But this time, we'll use the iron-icon element to do it.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.190
这么说来 iron-icon 的图标和安卓的等同  对吧
So iron-icon, icon equals android, right?

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.400
相当直截了当
Pretty straightforward.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.720
我可以直接启动一个本地服务器
I can go boot up a local server.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.640
然后我快速上滑到这里  你就能看到
And then I'll zoom in here, and you

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.560
显示出来的安卓图标
can see that we've got our Android icon displaying.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.270
然后这里就设置好了
So we're all good there.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.770
好了
OK.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.720
所以如果你想要添加一些额外的图标到你的应用
So if you go to the Element catalog

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.880
并查看这些图标
because you want to add some additional icons

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.577
是从哪里调用的话
to your application and you want to look up what they're called,

00:03:57.577 --> 00:03:59.160
逻辑上讲  你需要转到
logically, you're going to go and look

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.010
iron-icons 集合文件来查看
for the iron-icons element set docs.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.300
并且找到一个空白的页面
And what you're going to find is a blank page

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.730
因为现在在目录里有一个 BUG
because there is a bug in the catalog right now.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.817
那么我知道这个特殊的 URL 基本上就是说你从目录里的其他地方
So I know about this little special URL, which is basically

00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:12.150
获取一个 demo 文件  然后就
you take a demo file from somewhere else in the catalog,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.710
将这个 URL 替换为 iron-icons
and then you just replace the URL with iron-icons.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.140
实际上这操作会为你加载
And that's actually going to load

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.806
文件中的 iron-icons
in the docs for your iron-icons for you.

00:04:17.806 --> 00:04:18.950
高端的操作吧
It's a total hack.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.655
为了使各位学习更简单  我会给大家一些注释
To make your life easier, I will give you a little annotation

00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:23.490
点击这里就可以看见
here that you can click on.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.220
这回直接带你到图标设置
So this will take you right to the icon docs.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.670
这是我们在目录中已经打开过的一个 BUG
This is a bug that we have open in the catalog.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.630
很快这个 BUG 就能得到修复
We're going to get it fixed really soon.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.540
如果你是在本视频拍摄过后很久观看
If you're watching this in the future,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.500
很可能这个 BUG 已经被修复了
maybe it's already fixed.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.917
然而如果你是在今天观看
But if you're watching this today,

00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:36.125
并且你想要阅读这些文件  点击注释即可
and you want to read the docs, click that annotation.

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:38.150
这能使你避免一些麻烦
It'll save you a little bit of a headache there.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.920
现在  一旦我直接点击那 URL 我就能看到完整的
Now, once I hit that URL, I'm going to see the full default

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.050
默认元素集
elements set.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.640
以上就是我在我的 iron-icons 导入的全部内容
So this is everything that I got in my iron-icons import.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.098
如果我向下滚动鼠标  还能看到其他的我能在
And if I scroll down, there are actually other element sets

00:04:49.098 --> 00:04:51.900
我的应用中用到的元素集合
as well that I could use in my application.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.230
比如这个的名为 AV 的用于 audiovisual 图标
So here's one called AV for audiovisual icons.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.950
继续查看  我还在这里看到
And looking around, I can see that this AV snooze

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.650
AV snooze 插件的图标  就在这里  看上去很整洁
icon down here, right about here, looks pretty neat.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.150
对吧
Right?

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.330
可能我想在我的应用中用到
So maybe I want to use that in my application.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.170
然后我转回我的工程
So I'll hop back into my project.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.890
你能看到当我打开 iron-icon 集合的时候
And you'll see that when I open up the iron-icons set,

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.030
就在这个里面  有一点不同的图标设置
that inside of here, there's a few different icon sets.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.850
那儿就是 AV 图标
There are the AV icons.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.600
所以我需要做的就是导入那元素集
So I just need to import that element set.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.420
那么我就在我拖入这些 iron icons 之后点击导入
So I will drop an import after where I pulled in iron icons.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.420
就在这里   我要导入 AV 图标
And here, I'm going to import AV icons.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.360
现在所有的这些图标我都有权限使用
Now all of those icons will be available to me as well.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.330
所以我在 iron-icon 里拷贝然后放到显示 av：snooze 的框中
So copy in my iron-icon and drop in one that says av:snooze.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.457
那么任何时候你使用不在默认集合内的集合中的图标
And anytime you're using an icon from a set that is not

00:05:33.457 --> 00:05:35.540
只需加个前缀即可
the default set, you're going to need to prefix it

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.330
前缀包含集合名称和冒号
with the set name and a colon.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.180
现在当我转回我的编辑器的时候
Now when I hop back into my editor,

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.940
你能看到我的安卓图标
you can see I've got my Android icon,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.140
并且我能找到我的 AV snooze 图标
and I've got my AV snooze icon.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.100
现在  你知道我最后想说的事情是
Now, the last thing that I want to do-- as you recall,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.270
我们可以使用自定义属性设置这些元素风格
we can style the elements using these custom properties

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.550
比如宽度和高度
for width and height.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.900
那么我再转回我的编辑器
So I'm going to hop back into my editor

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.192
创建一个 theme.html 文档
and create a theme.html file.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.650
在文档中  我再创建一个用户风格
And inside of this file, I'm going to create a custom style

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.150
属性
property.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.480
这样样式就变成了自定义样式
So style is custom style.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.480
这就有点像是风格菜单
And I can treat this kind of like a style sheet.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.070
我将鼠标选中 iron-icon 元素
So I'll target the iron-icon element.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.486
现在我就能选中这里面的自定义属性
And now I can target the custom properties inside of this.

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:13.380
那么我就要使得这里所有的 iron-icons
So I'm just going to make all iron-icons have

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.640
很宽很高 这样它们基本上
a really big width and height so that they're

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.350
在很远的距离也能被看见
visible from space, basically.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.720
既然我设置了宽度和高度
So I've set width and height.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.990
我就来导入我的主题文档了
I'm going to import my theme file.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.520
现在我返回我的浏览器并且刷新页面
And now when I go back to my browser and refresh the page,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.970
看这就是我的巨大图标
I've got these ginormous icons.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.330
再次强调  把它们做得这么大是不对的
So again, it's kind of absurd to make them this big.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.560
但是这种图标的属性设置方法
But this way, you can globally set the size

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.760
是对你的所有 iron-icons 都适用的
for all of your iron-icons.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.724
或者如果你想通过类来选中它
Or if you wanted to target it by class,

00:06:37.724 --> 00:06:39.140
那么你能做上述不同的事情
you can do these different things.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.886
在这个案例中  自定义属性的作用
And in this case, it's not a very huge use

00:06:42.886 --> 00:06:43.760
并未完全发挥
of custom properties.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.430
但是我希望能帮助你对自定义属性尽快熟悉
But I want to get you familiar with custom properties.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.170
我希望你们对自定义属性的使用尽快上手
I want to get you comfortable using them

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.750
因为我们在将来会更多的使用到它们
because we're going to be using them a lot more in the future.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.680
这就是它的用法
So that about does it.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.880
现在你就领略了当前最新最犀利的
You've now got the latest and greatest info

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.329
关于图标如何在 Polymer 1.0 中的使用
on working with icons in Polymer 1.0.

00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:57.620
