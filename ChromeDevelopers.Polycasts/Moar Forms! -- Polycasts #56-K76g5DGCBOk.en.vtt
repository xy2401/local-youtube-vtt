MONICA DINCULESCU:
Hello Polycasters,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.707
and welcome to another
edition of The Meowni.ca Show.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:10.540
Last time when I was
here, I was telling you

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.360
about how to get your forms
to care about your custom

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.900
elements.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.050
And the thing that I showed
you was that you can basically

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.870
bind the property that
you care about in a custom

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.059
element to the value
of a hidden input,

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:24.100
because forms care about
hidden inputs and that's

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.960
how you can send
them to the server.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.880
Today, I'm going to
still talk about forms,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.690
but I'm going to
show you something

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.648
a little bit different.

00:00:29.648 --> 00:00:32.650
Oftentimes, you might be the
one writing your custom element,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.320
and all you need to do is just
make an input look prettier

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.110
because a native input
isn't the greatest.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.900
So if you want to just do that,
the way you can get around it

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.390
is to just make a wrapper
that just styles your input,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.130
and then your input is still
in the light DOM of the form,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.940
so the form just sees it as if
it was a normal input and not

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.240
a custom element.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.000
So let's go ahead and do this.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.304
Over here I have a form,
just like I had before.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:54.970
And it's styled.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.160
It's exactly the same
demo as last time.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.197
I'm still using httpbin,
and if you missed it,

00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:01.780
I was telling you it's a thing
that just basically echoes back

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.321
all the headers and
all the arguments

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.000
that you sent it,
which is great.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.820
So I have a form
and in it, I want

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.617
to do again the
birthday example, where

00:01:08.617 --> 00:01:10.450
I'm going to ask you
to put in your birthday

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.866
and then I'm going to send you
something on your birthday.

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:17.411
So I'm going to have an
input here inside the form.

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.910
And these inputs
have a placeholder,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.350
and they have a name and a date.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.100
So if they have a name,
the form cares about them

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.349
and it's going to submit them.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.450
So we can go ahead and
see what it looks like.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.100
You have a really ugly input,
but if I type something in it,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.620
by the magic of forms, I'm going
to send this day and the month

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.130
over there.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.090
But that's not what I want.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.464
I want to assemble
something that

00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:37.970
says birthday so that my server
knows what to do with it.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.980
So what I'm going
to go ahead and do

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.762
is first make these
inputs look great,

00:01:40.762 --> 00:01:42.220
because they're
terrible right now.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.184
And I'm going to wrap them
in a custom element that

00:01:46.184 --> 00:01:48.350
is going to take a label
that we're going to display

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.350
and just style, basically,
all of these inputs

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.770
that get distributed to it.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.650
So if you go over
here to our element,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.450
I'm going to add
the label, and it's

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.160
going to come as a
property, as you saw.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.050
So I'm going to actually
add it as a property

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.770
so that we can display it and
then a giant content block that

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.050
basically says,
display here everything

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.170
that you're passing me.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.702
And again, the styles aren't
any different than before.

00:02:08.702 --> 00:02:10.660
If you look at my shared
styles, the only thing

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.590
that I had to add was to also
style a distributed input,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.210
not just like a Shadow
DOM input, like before.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.180
So if you go back
to our form, I'm

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.090
going to actually import the
element so that it works.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.510
And now, if I refresh my
page, bam, pretty input.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.530
That's amazing.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.019
But whatever data
you pass in it,

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.310
it's still in the wrong
format, because I didn't really

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.456
fix that in any way.

00:02:31.456 --> 00:02:33.580
So we can go ahead and do
that by binding the value

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.913
that we get from a native event.

00:02:34.913 --> 00:02:38.350
So I'm going to, over here,
get the value from the input,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.290
and it's going to be whenever
the input fires an event,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.650
I'm going to put in a
property called month

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.147
and I'm going to do the same
for the day, only call it a day.

00:02:47.147 --> 00:02:49.230
And then I'm going to do
the same trick as before,

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.100
where I have a hidden
input and that thing

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.550
gets sent to the server.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.470
So I'm going to bind this
property month and this day,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.670
separate them by a
slash, and wrap these

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.460
all in a nice little down bind
so that the bindings actually

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.270
work.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.480
And if you go back to the demo,
put in a birthday as before,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.740
submit it, bam!

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.400
Look at that!

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.200
We have an argument
called birthday,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.550
and it's in the right format.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.600
The server is happy.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.730
I'm happy.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.910
The form is happy.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.050
I think we got this done.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.704
So that's it.

00:03:17.704 --> 00:03:19.620
That's another way that
you can get your forms

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.099
to care about custom elements.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.390
Thank you so much for watching.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.680
Hopefully I'll get
to see you again.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.380
I'll talk to Rob to see
if we can do this again.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.713
Please subscribe to the channel.

00:03:26.713 --> 00:03:28.510
If you have any
questions, comments below,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.820
or you can find me on
Twitter @notwaldorf.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.930
And that's it.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.830
Bye.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.880
Hi Polycasters, and welcome
to another edition of-- oh no.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.990
This is not another edition.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.290
Hello Poly-- oh [BLEEP].

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.640
Don't make me laugh.
