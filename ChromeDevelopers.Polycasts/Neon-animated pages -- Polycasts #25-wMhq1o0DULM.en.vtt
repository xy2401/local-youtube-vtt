00:00:03.092 --> 00:00:04.050
Hey there, Polycasters.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.150
Rob here.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.180
Animation is one of the
hallmarks of a really great web

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.259
experience.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.175
Not only does it make
your app just look cool.

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:14.082
But you can use them to
navigate the user from one

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:15.290
area of interest to the next.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.860
And ultimately, that makes
everything much more engaging.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.680
Now, in a previous
video, I showed you

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.266
how to animate a single item
using an animation behavior.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.640
But today I want
to teach you how

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.120
to animate whole
sections of your app,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.440
bringing shared elements
from one state to the next.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.980
And to do this, we're going
to use a component called

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.283
Neon Animated Pages.

00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:36.960
OK.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960
So this is the first thing
we're going to build.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.050
It is a very simple application.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.900
And we are going to add a little
Settings menu to this page,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.780
so that when you
click on it, it's

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.710
going to do some really
nifty transitions.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.290
It's going to actually
slide the other page in.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.170
And when you cancel it,
it's going to sort of push

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.830
the old page back over.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.950
Right?

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.550
So pretty cool stuff there.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.940
To start off, we are going
to jump into our Index file

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.089
for this project.

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.630
And the first thing
we're going to do

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.430
is we are just going to
load in some imports.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.180
So we're going to pull in
Neon Animated Pages as well

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.350
as the iron-flex-layout
classes, which we talked about

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.620
in our last episode, so we
can use some layout classes.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.580
And then down inside
of my body, I'm

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.505
going to just drop in
a dom-bind template,

00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:25.880
so I can use data
bindings in this space.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.290
I'm going to add a
neon-animated-pages element

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.890
right there.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.473
And you can see that I've also
gone ahead and actually applied

00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:34.360
some of those layout classes,
so that my body is using flexbox

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.850
to allow me to, as
you'll see in a second,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.440
flex the
neon-animated-pages element,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.750
so it takes up
the entire screen.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.680
I'm also going to give
it a selected attribute.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.920
And this is just like what
we did in our Iron Pages demo

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.600
last time, where Neon
Animated Pages is going

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.480
to look at whatever the
selected index is and display

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.220
that child.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.096
So if the selected
index is 0, it's

00:01:58.096 --> 00:01:59.470
going to display
its first child.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.160
If it's 1, it'll display
the second child, and so on,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.950
just like Iron Pages does.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.830
So that gives us a little bit
of a boilerplate to work from.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.710
I'm going to add an
ID to this template,

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.100
so I can select it
down in JavaScript.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.390
And then I will write
out a little script tag.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.410
And just go ahead and
querySelector for my app there.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.240
And give it an initial
selected value of 0.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.230
So this way, Animated
Pages is going

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.181
to try to display
its first child.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.930
We're going to drop
in two more elements--

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.319
list-page and settings-page.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.360
Those are going to be the
two elements that we're

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.690
going to transition between.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.050
So I'll go add some
imports for them.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.680
And then we are pretty
much ready to rock.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.540
So let's start by
defining what the list

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.250
page is going to look like.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.310
So we can switch
over to that tab.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.900
And it's pretty
typical element here.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.320
I've got my style tag
and my template tab

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.840
collapsed right
now, because they're

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.910
full of just placeholder markup.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.620
So if I expand that,
you can see there's

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.320
a bunch of HTML in there.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.611
But you don't actually need
to worry about any of that,

00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:05.319
because it's all just
dummy placeholder content

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.360
for the sake of the demo.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.126
So a lot of stuff, but you
can pretty much ignore it.

00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:11.500
To get rolling,
though, I'm going

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.040
to import a few items here.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.850
I'm going to import the
neon-animatable-behavior, which

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.240
you might remember from our
previous episode on Neon

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.380
Animation.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.810
And then I'm going
to pull in two

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.570
animations--
slide-from-left animation

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.852
and fade-out-animation.

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:27.310
So slide-from-left
is going to make

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.450
the page appear to come
from outside the left edge

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.692
of the screen onto the
center of the page like that.

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:35.650
And then the fade-out-animation,
as it implies,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.800
is just going to have
the page fade out.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.270
So then let us go down
here and like we've

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.000
done in previous
animation examples,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.390
we'll create a
properties object.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.810
We'll create an animation
config property.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.840
And then I'm going to give
it two animations, an entry

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.465
and an exit animation.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.840
And we're going to use those
animations that we imported.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.240
So our entry animation
will be slide from left.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.410
Our exit will be fade out.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.500
We also need to
remember to include

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.010
that neon-animatable-behavior.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.910
Now, if this does not
look familiar to you,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.960
please, please, please go
check out our previous episode

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.460
on Neon Animations.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.135
That will explain how
these behaviors are working

00:04:15.135 --> 00:04:16.760
and give you a little
bit more context.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.760
But for those of you who
are familiar with this,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.300
we can just kind of
steam right along.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.010
So we've added that behavior.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.880
We've got our animation
object all set up.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.110
So the list page is
pretty much done.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.430
I think we're ready to switch
over to our settings page.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.240
And again, you know, it's
full of dummy content

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.850
in the template and
in the style tag.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.859
So nothing that you really need
to worry about there just yet.

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:41.400
But we're going to
do the same thing.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.100
We're going to import the
neon-animatable-behavior

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.350
and then a couple transitions.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.100
Slide from right.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.010
And then slide right.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.260
So slide from right
means basically

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.850
come from off screen
to being on screen.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.910
And slide right means you're
already on screen, push off

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.250
to the right-hand side.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.410
Cool?

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.840
So just like we were
doing with our list page,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.680
we're going to go ahead
and implement the behavior.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.194
So we're going to roll
in neon-animatable.

00:05:10.194 --> 00:05:11.610
We're going to
create a properties

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.130
object with an animation
config property.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.010
Entry and exit animations.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.360
And for entry,
we're going to say

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.140
that we want this guy
to-- I believe we're going

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.280
to slide in from the right.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.830
Yep.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.780
And then for our exit, we
will slide out to the right.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.410
And both times, the
node is just going

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.040
to refer to this element itself.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.590
So we've got our two pages.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.720
They've got their animations
already set up and ready to go.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.120
Let's switch over
to the browser.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.910
We can actually preview this.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.290
And what I'm going to do is
a little dev tools trickery,

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.610
which you've seen me do before.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.180
I've got neon-animated-pages
selected right here

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.040
in the dev tools.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.980
And I've got my console open.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.910
So I can just hit $0,
and that will actually

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.170
allow me to grab a reference
to the neon-animated-pages

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.720
element.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.024
And I can just set selected
to a hard-coded value.

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:00.190
So I'll just switch it to 1.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.356
And you'll see what happens.

00:06:01.356 --> 00:06:02.320
The page changes.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.710
I switch it back to 0.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.880
The page goes back, right?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.110
Set it to 1.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.920
Page changes.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.380
Back to 0, page goes back.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.650
Now, we've got this
really cool relationship

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.959
between these animations.

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:15.500
You can see how they
sort of play off

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.372
of one another, which looks
really nice on perhaps

00:06:18.372 --> 00:06:19.580
a mobile device of some kind.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.204
It is a little bit
of a bummer, though,

00:06:21.204 --> 00:06:24.410
to have to manually change the
selected value in this way.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.472
So let's fix that.

00:06:25.472 --> 00:06:26.930
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.721
going to have our
elements dispatch events.

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:31.810
When we hear those events, we'll
tell the animated pages element

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:32.820
to update.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.160
So we can actually pop
inside of the template there.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.200
And I'm going to take
the Settings button

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.710
and just give it
an on-tap handler

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.980
and a method called
showSettings.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.650
And then to implement that,
I'm just going to fire an event

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.727
called showSettings.

00:06:45.727 --> 00:06:47.810
I'll do the exact same
thing on the Settings page.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.240
I'll find its Cancel button,
another on-tap handler.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.370
This time we'll say showList.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.350
And we'll do another event.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.280
Dispatcher basically.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.290
So we're just going to fire off
another event called showList.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.374
And then back in
our Index page, this

00:07:00.374 --> 00:07:02.040
is going to be a
little quick and dirty.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.581
But what I'm going
to do is I'll just

00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:06.450
listen at the document
level for those events.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.180
So normally, you would probably
have this neon-animated-pages

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.980
and these elements.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.688
You'd probably have
this inside of maybe,

00:07:12.688 --> 00:07:14.640
like, a bigger
element of some kind.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.117
So you could use,
like, on-dash listeners

00:07:17.117 --> 00:07:18.200
to listen to these things.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.783
You'd be like, oh, yeah, I want
to listen to on-show-settings.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.360
And when I hear that,
that's when I'll

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.030
update my selected property.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.500
In this case, we're just doing
a quick little demo here,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.671
so we'll just listen
right on the document.

00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:35.670
With that in place, I
think we're actually good.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.340
We can switch back to Chrome.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.722
And then when we click our
little button up there,

00:07:39.722 --> 00:07:41.180
it's going to fire
the event, which

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.300
is going to trigger a
change in animated pages.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.810
And we'll click
that Cancel button.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.112
And likewise.

00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:49.720
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.290
Now, if you want
all of your pages

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.970
to use the same
transitions, it would

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.230
be really inconvenient to have
to copy and paste that code

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.846
over and over and over again.

00:07:57.846 --> 00:07:59.720
But thankfully, we can
work around that using

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.291
a feature that's built
into the element itself.

00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:02.790
OK.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.770
For our second demo, I've got
this very simple transition

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:07.270
thing.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.330
Each one of these is a page.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.460
Each one of these big colored
blocks is actually a page.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.376
And as I'm clicking, you
can see that they all

00:08:12.376 --> 00:08:15.880
use the exact same
transition animation.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.760
So looking at our code, it
looks just like our old example.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.650
We've got a neon-animated-pages
element here.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.150
Right?

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.480
We're using some layout classes.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.290
We're flexing it.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.979
We've got a selected
binding right there.

00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:29.520
And then I've got
this little handler

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.160
that I've added just
for demo purposes

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.130
called on-tap, where I've
got this next method.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.929
And I'm just looping through
possible selected values.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.664
So we're incrementing up
until we reach the max.

00:08:39.664 --> 00:08:41.900
And then we're
looping around again.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.600
Now, I've got the same element
in each of these slots, right?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.820
And I know that I'm going
to want all of these

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.980
to use the same transition.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.590
Even if I didn't have
the same element here,

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.090
maybe I would want all of them
to use the same transition.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:58.830
So instead of having to go into
each and every one and copy

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.080
and paste that behavior
over and over again,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.490
what I'm going to do
is just take advantage

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.670
of this convenience feature
that animated-pages offers,

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.810
where I can go up to
the top, and I can just

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.720
import the animations
that I want it to use,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.490
as if we were building
an animatable element.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.465
But I'll just pull in
a scale-up animation

00:09:17.465 --> 00:09:19.225
and a fade-out animation.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.660
And then we're just going
to tell animated pages,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.850
hey, for all of your
entry animations,

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.975
just play the scale-up
animation for all of these.

00:09:26.975 --> 00:09:28.650
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:29.520
Just play that.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.570
And for all the exit
animations, just play

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.132
the fade-out animation.

00:09:33.132 --> 00:09:34.840
So if you know you
want all of your pages

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.790
to use the exact same
intro and exit animations,

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.300
this is some
shorthand that you can

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.650
do that will save you quite
a lot of typing if you have

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.920
a bunch of different
elements that all basically

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.300
need the same transitions.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.633
So with this in place, we're
actually pretty good to go.

00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:51.020
We can switch back to the
browser and click on the thing.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.600
And we're going to get
that exact same behavior.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.899
And it's saved us
quite a lot of typing.

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:57.690
Now, the last thing
that I want to touch on

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.190
is something that I promised
at the beginning of the video--

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.480
this idea of being able to take
elements and transition them

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.270
from one page to
the next, right?

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.640
Actually pulling along
what neon-animated-pages

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.100
refers to as shared elements.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.430
So let me show you an
example of doing that.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.200
I've got a very simple app here.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.859
And it's got this sort of
large Sign In button of sorts.

00:10:19.859 --> 00:10:21.650
And when I go click on
that Sign In button,

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.570
you'll see that it's
going to transition

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.350
and become the header
of my next page.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.020
So let's do that again, right?

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.520
So I've actually
taken that element,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.420
and sort of morphed it into
an element on another page,

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.600
and sort of carried it
from page one to page two.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.120
So again, this is a
shared element transition.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.400
And in particular, this one
is called a hero transition

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.950
or a hero animation.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.940
So implementing this is
actually pretty easy.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.590
Though the effects themselves
look very sophisticated,

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.130
they're pretty easy to
implement once you know how.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.780
So in my Index page, again,
just like the previous examples,

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.120
I've got
neon-animated-pages, right?

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.090
I'm flexing it.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.460
It's got the selected
binding there.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.280
We're using a little
cheating next handler

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.542
to advance the page.

00:11:05.542 --> 00:11:07.250
And I've got two
elements inside of here.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.580
One is called main-page,
though maybe I should

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.840
have called that sign-in-page.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.950
But main-page.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.890
And detail-page, which is going
to be the page with the header.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.092
So this is our main page.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.550
And I want you to
notice that we've

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.060
got this div with an
ID of circle here.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.630
So this is really,
really important.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.480
And we're going to come
back to this later.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.850
But just know that it
exists inside of this page.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.720
And before we do anything, I'm
going to go up and check out

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.750
our imports.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.920
So instead of the
neon-animatable-behavior,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.360
I've actually got
this thing which

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.437
is very similar, though
an even longer name,

00:11:35.437 --> 00:11:37.395
called neon shared element
animatable behavior.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.360
So this actually implements
all the same stuff

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.900
as the neon-animatable-behavior.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.760
But it gives us this
magical shared element

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.626
extra awesome sauce, which
we will use in just a second.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.250
And then I've got
two animations that I

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.860
pulled in here-- hero-animation
and fade-out-animation.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.680
So let's implement both
of those right now.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.280
So we'll go down
and just like we've

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.340
done in previous examples,
we will add the behavior

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.560
to our element.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.196
So this time, we're going to
add the neon shared element

00:12:08.196 --> 00:12:09.029
animatable behavior.

00:12:11.222 --> 00:12:12.680
We will create a
properties object.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.055
And in that
properties object, we

00:12:14.055 --> 00:12:17.170
will drop in an
animation config object.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.391
We'll have entry
and exit animations.

00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:21.140
The entry animation
doesn't really matter,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.560
because we're not going to
play it in this example,

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.189
but I'll just
throw one in there.

00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:26.230
The exit animation, though--
pay attention here--

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.910
I'm actually creating an array
of animations-- so animations

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.120
that would be playing
simultaneously.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.500
The first one is going to
be that hero-animation.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.800
And we're going to
give it an ID property.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.120
And we're going to say that
we want to hero-animate

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.040
a thing with the idea of hero.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.130
And this does not refer to a CSS
ID, which confused me at first.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.030
So this is not a CSS ID.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.490
This is an ID that we are
going to define in JavaScript.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.810
So kind of keep that
in mind for the moment.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.260
And then we're going to say
that this page right here

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:08.510
is the from page, meaning that
this hero element that we're

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.680
going to refer to is
coming from this page,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.910
and it's going to another page,
which we will demonstrate when

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.385
we implement the next element.

00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:17.760
And then we're
going to implement

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.076
a second animation, which is
just going to be fade-out.

00:13:21.076 --> 00:13:22.450
And we're going
to basically say,

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.800
everything else on this
page should fade out

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.220
when we're exiting.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.390
So let's go define
this hero ID thing.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.550
And the way we're going to do
that is through this shared

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.160
elements object.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.830
So remember, I've got
this circle up here,

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.510
right, this thing
with ID of circle.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.440
And that's really what I
want to hero-transition.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.080
So I'm going to add this
shared elements object.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.500
And I'm going to
tell it-- by the way,

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.740
it looks a lot like our
animation config object.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.245
It's a value that turns a
function [INAUDIBLE] an object.

00:13:56.245 --> 00:13:59.160
But we're going to say
that when we say hero,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.700
what we're actually talking
about is this .$circle.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.130
And the reason why we do
this is because this term

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.030
is going to be used
in both elements--

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.160
the from page and the to page.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.440
So it's a shared term
referring to different things

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.000
on different pages.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.770
So here, hero refers
to that circle.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.975
Let's go implement the
next page, the detail page.

00:14:19.975 --> 00:14:23.060
And you'll see that we've got
the same imports pretty much.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.350
We've got shared-element,
hero-animation,

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.600
fade-out-animation, fade-in.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.620
We're going to also
implement our behavior.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.220
We're going to drop in an
animation config object.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.304
And for the exit animation,
doesn't really matter,

00:14:39.304 --> 00:14:40.803
because we're not
going to play one.

00:14:40.803 --> 00:14:42.480
But I'll just add
an exit animation.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.438
But here we are again
with the entry animation.

00:14:44.438 --> 00:14:46.250
Again, it's an
array of animations.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.690
And note that we're
using the hero animation.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.940
The ID that we're
referring to is still hero.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.930
But now we're saying
that this is the to page.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.410
So the first element
was the from page.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.739
This is the to page
where hero is going to.

00:15:00.739 --> 00:15:02.780
And then for the rest of
the content on the page,

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.970
we're just going to fade it
in when we're doing entry.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.291
And then we're going to go
define its shared elements

00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:09.790
object.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.248
And what we're
going to say here is

00:15:11.248 --> 00:15:13.910
that when we say
hero in this element,

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.370
we're referring to our element
with the ID of header, right?

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.410
So hero in the other
one refers to circle.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.630
Hero over here
refers to our header.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.960
And it is up to
neon-animated-pages now

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.360
and it is up to that
hero animation behavior

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.480
to sort of interpolate
between A and B,

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.640
right, to get us
from there to here.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.140
Right?

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.380
So let's go and
give that a shot.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.760
We will go back to our browser
and click on our circle.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.140
And you see we get that nice
transition over to our header.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.680
Now, this is a pretty simple
implementation of this pattern

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.490
though it is a
really cool effect.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.560
But what I'd like to show
you is if you go over

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.860
to the Elements catalog at
elements.polymerproject.org.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.810
And you click on this Neon
Animation button down here,

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.260
there is this
really awesome guide

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.800
full of really helpful
stuff on Neon Animations.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.930
But at the bottom, there are
all of these really great demos.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.030
And one in particular, which
I sort of based this on,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.470
is this one called, like,
Squares to Circles or Circles

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.670
to Squares, I think.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.472
And it is a much more
advanced implementation

00:16:18.472 --> 00:16:20.680
of what I just showed you,
where all of these circles

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.620
are actually dynamic
hero transitions, which

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.520
is really cool.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.560
But it involves a
fair bit more code.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.900
So once you feel like you
understand the original hero

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.700
animation, go
check this one out.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.660
Go try it out and
see how you do.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.330
But now you know
everything that you

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.950
need to start creating some
really, really sick animations

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.211
in your Polymer apps.

00:16:40.211 --> 00:16:42.585
So the next time you want to
add a really fancy animation

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.250
to your application,
you can just say,

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.430
hey, there's an
element for that.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.746
Now, if you've enjoyed this
video, be sure to go down

00:16:48.746 --> 00:16:50.370
and click that little
Subscribe button.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.140
That's actually how we
get to keep making these.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.080
And if you have questions,
you can leave them for me

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.180
down in the comments.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.360

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.570
As always, thank you
so much for watching,

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:02.877
and I'll see you next time.
