Polycast is for
anybody who's really

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.925
into web components in Polymer.

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:04.290
If you're an absolute
beginner, you

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.570
haven't worked with
these things before, I'm

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.550
going to give you some getting
started material, show you how

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.800
to work with a few components.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.620
If you're a more
advanced developer,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.414
I actually have
some tips and tricks

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:13.830
and other cool
stuff that's coming

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.502
exclusive from
the Polymer teams.

00:00:15.502 --> 00:00:17.960
So you get to hear about it
before pretty much anybody else

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.948
in the outside world.

00:00:18.948 --> 00:00:20.656
We've got a little
bit of Hollywood magic

00:00:20.656 --> 00:00:22.300
that we've incorporated
into the show

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.200
so that I can draw
on the screen,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.630
I can point out the
particulars of the code,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.410
and I can actually bring you
inside the text editor with me.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.102
So it can feel more like we're
building a component together,

00:00:32.102 --> 00:00:34.560
and not like you're just sitting
there watching some video.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.830
Polycast comes out on the
Google Developers YouTube

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.079
channel every two weeks.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.620
So you can subscribe
to that channel.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.280
And that way, you will
never miss an episode,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.420
which is pretty awesome.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.804
You can also go find our
playlist on the channel.

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:46.220
You can bookmark
that, and you can

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.042
see the entire back catalog.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:50.000
One thing I would say to
any developer watching

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.872
is that if you
really like the show,

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:53.580
leave me a comment
down there on YouTube.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.770
I read all of the comments.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.861
I try to respond to as
many as I possibly can.

00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:58.610
And when you leave a
really good question,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.370
we can highlight it
in future episodes.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.460
Today on Polycast,
I'm going to show you

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.660
a very important trick.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.560
So let's dive in.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.629
