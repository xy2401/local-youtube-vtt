还没有接触过这些东西  我会
haven't worked with these things before, I'm

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.550
给你一些便于你入门的材料  给你演示
going to give you some getting started material, show you how

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.800
如何操作一些组件

我有一些小贴士和技巧
I actually have some tips and tricks

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.500

提早知道
in the outside world.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.650
我们用了一些神奇的东西
We've got a little bit of Hollywood magic

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.300
来应用到节目里
that we've incorporated into the show

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.200
我可以在屏幕上画画

而且我可以带你们一起进入文本编辑器
and I can actually bring you inside the text editor with me.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.100
这样的感觉更像是我们在一起创建组件
So it can feel more like we're building a component together,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.560
而不是你干坐在那看视频
