00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:04.560
 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.560
Hey, there, Polycasters.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.640
Rob here-- welcome
back to the show.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.400
As we've been
working on Polymer,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.000
one of the probably
biggest requests

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.890
that comes in from
developers is,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.090
when are we going to get a
CDN for Polymer and for Web

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.730
Components?

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.330
Because it's kind of a
pain in the butt every time

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.490
you want to sort
of hack on an idea.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.532
And you've got to use Bower
and install a bunch of packages

00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:26.490
and wait for everything
to download just so you

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.290
can, you know, play with stuff.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.450
So recently, the
Polymer team has

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.330
put out a brand-new project,
which is called Polygit.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.140
It is a development
CDN-- which, I'll

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.050
talk about what that word
means in just a second.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.530
But basically, it is
a CDN that includes

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.652
Polymer, all the Polymer
elements, and the Web

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:45.860
Components polyfill. s So
if you want to hack around,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.526
using something like
JS Bin and Polymer,

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:48.590
you can totally do that.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.300
So if you go to the
website polygit.org,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.099
you see that it bills itself
as the Polymer Magic Server.

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:56.890
And what it's actually
doing under the hood

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.130
is it's just using
GitHub's RawGit CDN

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.730
and extracting things from there
and pulling them into JS Bin,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.897
or wherever you
want to use the CDN.

00:01:05.897 --> 00:01:07.480
So what I want to
do here is just sort

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.930
of like show you some examples
of how you can use the CDN,

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.430
how you can configure
it to actually

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.690
pull in your own
packages as well,

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.230
and basically just get
hacking really quick.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.000
So over on jsbin.com,
I've already

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.980
set up this little sample bin.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.640
And the main thing
I notice here is,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.650
I'm using this base
tag right here.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.040
And if you're not familiar
with the base tag in HTML,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.150
or a base element-- it just
allows you to set a URL.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.800
And then any sort of
subsequent URLs that you use,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.410
like for script
tags or imports--

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.450
they will all be
relative to that base.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.050
So what we're saying here is
we want the base URL to be

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.070
polygit.org/components.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.560
This components
directory is where

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.393
Polymer and all the
Polymer elements and all

00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:48.800
that good stuff lives.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.460
And from here on out, if
we have any relative URLs,

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.800
it'll just pull stuff
from that directory.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.930
So I'm pulling in
Web Components JS,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.300
it's coming from that directory.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.780
I can import
polymer.html-- that'll

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.760
also come from that directory.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.670
And so, since we've got all
this working off of our CDN,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.420
now we can actually
sit here-- if we want,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.150
we can just create our
own Polymer element right

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.949
on JS Bin.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.170
So I'm going to do that.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.740
Write out a dom module here.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.960
I'll give it an id of x-foo.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.990
And I'll give it a template that
just says, Hello from x-foo.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.880
And I'll also give it a little
script tag inside of here.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.250
We will call the
Polymer constructor.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.179
And we're going to say
it is an x-foo element.

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.720
And then the last
thing we want to do

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.280
is we want to just make sure
that we use our x-foo tag

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.270
somewhere in the page.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.027
And now you can see it showing
up over there in our output.

00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:41.860
So this is really great
if you're, you know,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.730
hanging out on the
Polymer Slack channel.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.412
You run into a
bug or some issue,

00:02:45.412 --> 00:02:47.620
and you're not quite sure
how to explain it to folks.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.230
You can just go
throw it together

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.140
in JS Bin using
Polygit, and then

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.290
share that JS Bin with people so
they can help you get unstuck.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.320
Now, I also mentioned
that all the Polymer

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.360
elements that we've built are
included in the CDN as well.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.160
So what you can also do, if you
find maybe a bug or an issue

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.710
with something like paper-tabs,
is you can go over here.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.840
And you can just write an
html import for paper-tabs.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.542
So instead of just polymer,
I'll also pull in paper-tabs.

00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:16.000
And then you can just start
using that element in your page

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.499
here.

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.530
So I'll say I want
a set of paper-tabs.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.450
And then inside of
here, I will write out

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.280
maybe two or three paper-tabs.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.400
So we'll say the first
tab is called FOO,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.040
second one is going to be called
BAR, and last one will be BAZ.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.682
FOO, BAR, BAZ.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:36.390
And there you go.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.070
Now over here in
our output, I've

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.400
got these three
paper-tabs working

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.840
just as I was expecting.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.670
And if I had some issue,
I could then take this.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.940
I could save this JS Bin.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.920
I could go file a GitHub
issue and point the engineer

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.207
at this particular JS Bin.

00:03:51.207 --> 00:03:53.040
And that way, it's going
to help them triage

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.260
that issue a lot
faster, and help

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.690
them debug the actual problem
that you're running into,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.327
and hopefully get things fixed.

00:03:58.327 --> 00:04:00.160
Now, one of the coolest
things about Polygit

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.660
is that it is configurable.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.720
So not only does it pull
in Polymer and the elements

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.460
that that team has created,
but you can add your own GitHub

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.160
repos to it as well.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.410
So if we go back to the
polygit.org website,

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.012
you scroll down
here to the bottom,

00:04:13.012 --> 00:04:14.470
you can see that
there is this sort

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.050
of interesting
configuration syntax.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.529
And it might look a little
weird when you first see it.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.079
It took me a few times
kind of working through it

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.160
to understand what it's doing.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.710
But basically,
what you want to do

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.260
is, when you are
defining that base URL,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.400
you can configure
it by saying, oh, I

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.800
would also like to
include this component.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.840
And this component might live
inside of some particular org.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.870
And maybe you want a particular
version, like version 1.2.3.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.420
Or maybe you want
a branch, right?

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.110
Maybe you want
the master branch.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.120
That is some good
handwriting right there.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.310
Or maybe you want
just the latest tags.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.110
So if you include
an asterisk instead

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.960
of pulling a particular
version or branch,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.030
it'll just give you whatever
the latest tag happens to be.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.070
So to shoot an example
of that, I have again,

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.710
got a little JS Bin here.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.210
And I'm just going to
paste in a better URL here.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.260
So what I've done is I've
configured Polygit to pull

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.560
in two additional dependencies.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.310
The first is the marked
mark-down JS library, which

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.860
is in the chjj org on GitHub.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.700
And I've told it to
grab the latest tag.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.550
Now, I've also told it to pull
in the mark-down element, which

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.420
is something that I wrote myself
that lives in the Rob Dodson

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.700
org on GitHub.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.640
And again, I've just told it to
pull in the latest tag there.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.430
So now both of those are
available in that CDN

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.410
components directory.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.770
So I can just go ahead and
write an HTML import to pull

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.820
in the mark-down element.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.570
 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.940
And then over in my body,
I can just start using it.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.810
So I can have a markdown tag.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.090
And we'll just drop in like
a Hello World for the header

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.057
there.

00:06:00.057 --> 00:06:01.640
And we can see we're
getting this sort

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.740
of like huge H1 rendering
over there in the output.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.840
So if you're working on
an element or a project

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.340
or something like
that, and you want

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.690
to show that to folks on
JS Bin, you can absolutely

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.130
do that using Polygit as well.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.770
The one caveat
there is that it has

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.780
to have been published for
at least one hour for it

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.570
to be picked up by the
RawGit caching CDN.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.640
But once it's been
published for about an hour,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.040
it should be available
to you on Polygit.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.797
Now, the last thing I
want to mention here

00:06:27.797 --> 00:06:29.380
is, at the very
beginning of the show,

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.670
we said that this is a sort
of development time CDN.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.480
And what I mean by
that is it's not a CDN

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.272
that you want to
use for production.

00:06:36.272 --> 00:06:37.730
And the reason is
because we're not

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.350
doing any sort of like
Vulcanization or anything

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.870
like that to optimize
the elements that we're

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.560
sending down.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.410
Instead, you're getting
an individual dependency

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.951
for everything that
you import, which

00:06:46.951 --> 00:06:50.580
is actually pretty expensive
in terms of HTTP requests.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.757
So it's great for
development time.

00:06:52.757 --> 00:06:54.340
It's great for hacking
a lot of ideas.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.975
But when you get
to the point where

00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:57.530
you want to launch
something into production,

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.655
you still want to use a
package manager like Bower.

00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:01.630
You still want to use a
process like Vulcanized

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.380
to make sure you're sitting down
the absolute smallest payload

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.136
possible.

00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:07.760
But, you know, if you just want
to mess around with some ideas,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.294
it's perfect for that.

00:07:09.294 --> 00:07:10.710
So that about
covers it for today.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.834
If you have any questions,
please leave them for me

00:07:12.834 --> 00:07:13.824
down in the comments.

00:07:13.824 --> 00:07:16.490
Or you can always hit me up on a
social network of your choosing

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.350
at #AskPolymer.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.130
As always, thank you
so much for watching,

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.255
and I'll see you next time.
