ROB DODSON: Hey, everyone.

00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:03.572
What's up?

00:00:03.572 --> 00:00:04.350
It's Rob Dodson.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.580
Today is a very special
episode of Polycasts

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.250
because Polymer 0.8
is finally upon us,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.110
so I'm going to be
showing you how to create

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.580
your own elements with it.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.432
Let's dive in.

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:16.140
So this is what I'm
going to build today.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.041
It's a very simple alert banner.

00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:19.540
It's the kind of
thing you might see

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.050
after a user completes
an action or receives

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.760
a notification of some kind.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.440
In the creating element, you're
going to need three things.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.110
You need the web
components polyfills,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.250
and these ensure that
your element shows up

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.900
in different browsers.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.740
You're going to
need Polymer itself.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.800
And lastly, you're going to need
a separate HTML file to hold

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.420
your elements definition.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.550
Now, registering a tag in
Polymer 0.8 is pretty easy.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.330
You call the
Polymer constructor,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.980
you pass in an object
with an "is" property,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.530
and then you give it a tag name.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.850
It's really important that your
tag include a dash in the name.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.170
What this does is it
signifies to the browser, hey,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.860
I'm creating a
custom element here.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.510
You need to make sure to
treat it kind of special.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.300
And once you've got all
of this in place, ta-da!

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.349
You've just created
your own HTML tag.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.770
Now, you could just
start using this new tag,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.570
but it's a little boring because
it doesn't actually display

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.170
anything, so let's change that.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.860
To render content
inside of an element,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.340
you're going to need to
include a DOM module tag

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.410
with a template inside of it.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.920
You can think of this kind of
like the old Polymer element

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.660
if you've worked with
previous versions.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.170
It's important to make sure you
give your DOM module an ID that

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.370
matches your tag
name, and what this

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.250
does is it helps Polymer find
your content so it knows what

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.160
to render.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.610
Inside of this template, I can
include really whatever I want.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.030
I can drop in a div
with an alert message.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.430
But what I want to do is
actually take this up a notch.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.970
I want to let the user pass
in the message for my alert.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.200
So instead of hard coding
some text in there,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.460
I'm going to include another
element called a content tag.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.700
I've talked about content
tags in a previous episode.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.410
You can catch this
video down here

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.500
if you want to learn a
little bit more about them.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.170
In short, they let
content from the lite DOM

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.235
get projected and rendered
inside of my element.

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:05.110
OK, I think I've talked
enough at this point.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.693
I'm sure you're ready to go, so
let's hop into our code editor

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.440
and get hacking.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.390
So over my bower.json, I've got
two dependencies listed here.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.692
I've got webcomponents.js, which
is pointing at version 0.6,

00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:17.400
and I've got polymer,
which right now I'm

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.439
pointing at the
0.8 preview branch,

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.480
and that's because at the
time of this recording,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.400
0.8 isn't even out yet.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.040
But if you check
the Polymer site

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.270
and it looks like
0.8 has landed,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.630
then you're good to go
ahead and change this

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.810
to the actual 0.8 tag.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.710
Then I'm going to hop
over to my terminal,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.320
and I'm going to
run bower install.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.479
This will pull down all
of those dependencies.

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.270
And this one I'm pretty
much ready to rock,

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.820
so in my index.html
file, I'm going

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.609
to first include the polyfills
for webcomponents.js.

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.150
Now, you'll notice here that
I'm using webcomponents-lite.js.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.580
webcomponents-lite.js is all the
web components' polyfills minus

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.700
the Shadow DOM polyfill.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.610
The reason I'm doing this is
because Polymer 0.8 includes

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.620
its own much more performant
variation of the Shadow DOM

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.540
polyfill, which is
called Shady DOM.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.030
Now I'm going to talk about
Shady DOM a bunch in a future

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.530
episode, but for now if you
just want to get rolling,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.570
you can just include
webcomponents-lite.js,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.350
and you should be good to go.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.140
Next I'm going to create an HTML
file called quick-alert.html,

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.080
and this is where I'm going to
define my elements definition.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.900
So I'm going to include
an import for Polymer that

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.250
ensures the Polymer has
been loaded before I

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.980
try to register my tag.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.730
And then I'm going to
drop in a DOM module

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.370
element and a template.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.980
Lastly, I've got to give
my DOM module an ID which

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.710
matches my element's name.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.610
Inside this template, I can
create whatever sort of content

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.810
I want, so I'm going to
drop in an alert message,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.100
and I'm also going to
include some CSS styles.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.980
Now, you may have not seen
this host selector before.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.160
That might be new for you.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.909
So the host selector
is actually something

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.860
that was added by the Shadow
DOM CSS spec, and what it does

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.230
is it allows an element
to refer to itself.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.040
It basically allows
this quick-alert tag

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.622
to tell the browser, hey, this
is how I should be rendered.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:10.080
And you can include other things
inside of your style block

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.910
if you want.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.660
I've got an alert class here,
which is referring to my div

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.550
down here.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.040
That works, as well.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.700
The last thing I'm going to
do is include a script tag

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.579
and kick off the
Polymer constructor

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.490
and pass in my tag name.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.423
Now, over in my
index.html, I'm going

00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:27.080
to import the definition
for my quick-alert element.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.100
And then I'm just going
to use the tag on my page.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.930
Hop over to Chrome, and you
can see that the new tag is

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.350
rendering just as we expected.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.910
So the last thing we need to
do is pass in a content element

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.740
so that the user can hand
off any message they want.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.420
So back in my
elements definition,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.340
I'm going to replace this
hard-coded text with a content

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.670
element.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.650
And now in my index file,
I can pass whatever message

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.160
I want into the
quick-alert tag, and that's

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.400
what's actually going to render
when I hop over to Chrome

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.950
and check it out in my browser.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.970
And there you have it--
your very first element

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.654
in Polymer 0.8.

00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:04.570
Now, we have just barely
scratched the surface

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.040
of what is in this new release.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.623
So in the upcoming
episodes, I'm going

00:05:07.623 --> 00:05:09.850
to be looking at more
of the features in 0.8.
