[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.928 --> 00:00:03.550
Hey, everyone.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.050
What's up?

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.900
It's Rob Dodson.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.250
Palmer 1.0 is in the
house and today, I'm

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.850
going to introduce you to the
brand new Polymer Starter Kit.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.470
So come on down and
let's get hacking.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.370
So Polymer Starter Kit is
brand new opinionated scaffold

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.050
for building
Polymer apps, and it

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.220
is jam packed full of awesome.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.050
Out of the box, it provides
a really nice layout

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.480
that leverages the latest
1.0 material design elements.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.620
It also has support for theming
using custom properties,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.940
and we showed these off
in the last episode.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.740
Now you're seeing it
kind of at a bigger

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.424
scale, which is really cool.

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:41.590
The other really awesome
thing about the Starter Kit

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.820
is that it comes
with optional support

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.620
for offline first
development, which

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.840
means in your
application, you can go.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.030
You could set it into Airplane
mode, refresh the browser,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.571
and everything would still load.

00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:58.320
You could even navigate
to different pages

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.530
within your application.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.420
Things would still work.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.590
What's doing this
magic behind the scenes

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.725
is a new technology
called Service Worker,

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:08.100
and I'm going to talk more
about that in a future episode

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.757
because it's just so cool.

00:01:10.757 --> 00:01:11.840
So how do you get started?

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.490
Well, there's two approaches.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.140
You could head over to the
Polymer Starter Kit home page

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.890
and download the zip bundle.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.980
That is one way to do it.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.920
Or, if you want to
be a hotshot like me,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.614
you can install the
Polymer Yeoman Generator.

00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:27.030
The generator pulls down the
latest version of the Starter

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.006
Kit so anytime you want to
just spin up a new project,

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.380
you just go to
your command line,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.400
you type "yo polymer," and
boom, you're ready to rock.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.040
Now, once you're set up,
bust open your editor

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.240
and this is what you should see.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.820
The files in the
root of the project

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.900
are dedicated to things
like package management--

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.250
I've got a package JSON here--
linters with JSNRC and JSCSRC.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.840
So all this is build type stuff.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.940
Up here in the App
Directory, this

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.720
is actually where all of
the UI for my application

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.470
is going to live.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.700
And because I downloaded
the version that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.180
has support for the
Gulp build process,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.600
I've also got a Gulp file here.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.840
But if you went with the light
version which doesn't include

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.980
Gulp, that's totally fine.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.063
You don't necessarily need
this for this tutorial,

00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:19.080
but I just want you to
know that that's there.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.480
So all of these files might
seem really overwhelming,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.382
but don't panic.

00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:23.840
There's tons of
great stuff in here

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.840
and I'm going to help
walk you through all of it

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.580
over the next few
episodes of Polycast.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.825
For today, let's just
start really small.

00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:31.450
We're going to preview
the app and then

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.400
we're going to update
some of the theme colors.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.715
Now, because the Starter
Kit uses Gulp for its

00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:39.090
build process, I'm going to
hop onto my terminal and type

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.405
out "gulp serve," which will
put boot a local server,

00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:44.050
and it's even going to
open my browser for me,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.130
which is pretty awesome.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.550
Nice.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.390
Now, if you're using
the light version

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.090
of the site which
doesn't include Gulp,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.250
you can use your own server.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.810
So here, I'm just booting
up Python simple HTTP server

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.449
on port 3,000.

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.740
And then I would need to go
and open my browser myself,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.520
but this is an option
for the folks who

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.760
downloaded that version.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.470
Next, I'm going to open
up my elements.html file

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.710
and I'm going to drop
in a paper FAB, which

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.500
is short for Floating
Action Button.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.494
So I scroll down.

00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:18.660
There's a lot of elements
that are imported already,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.910
but just right underneath
the Paper toolbar here,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.180
I'll drop in my own
import for Paper FAB.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.030
So I can have a little bit of
UI showing up on the screen.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.020
Next, I'm going to hop
over to my index.html file.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.372
And in the section that
says "data route home,"

00:03:34.372 --> 00:03:36.580
I'm going to take this
paragraph here and just delete

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.160
it and replace it with my
floating action button.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.770
So get rid of this p-tag
and drop in that paper FAB

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.090
and give it an icon of Add.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.412
Now when I save this and
go back to my browser,

00:03:51.412 --> 00:03:52.870
that floating action
button is just

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.420
going to be there on screen
even though I haven't hit

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.210
Refresh or anything like that.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.610
Now, the way that
this is working

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.550
is the Gulp version
of the Starter Kit

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.540
comes with a tool
called Browser Sync,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.030
and Browser Sync synchronizes
updates to all of your devices

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.170
whenever you save
files in your editor.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.530
So if I had a phone or a tablet
plugged into my laptop right

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.610
now, I was trying to
debug on all of them once,

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.415
they would all refresh
all at the same instant,

00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:19.290
which is really cool.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.890
Next, I'm going to open
up the apptheme.html file.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.140
And if you watched
the previous episode,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.530
this should look kind
of familiar to you.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.530
Inside of this file, we've
got custom properties

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.180
for theming our
entire application.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.660
So you see, I've got this
root pseudo class up here,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.868
and then a few different
custom properties over there

00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:39.650
on the right.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.290
Now, I can use these.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.840
These are basically the hooks
that all of the material design

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.490
elements in the application
have exposed to me

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.670
so that I can style
and theme them.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.280
This root pseudo
class right here,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.654
if you've never
seen one of those

00:04:51.654 --> 00:04:54.410
before, that just targets the
highest parent in the page,

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.500
and it's a good place to provide
some values for our custom

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.710
properties.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.780
Now, a way to do that
is to go over to a site

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.080
called Material Palette, and you
can actually just select colors

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.040
that you want to use.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.670
These are all coming from the
material design color palette.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.972
You can just click
on a few swatches.

00:05:11.972 --> 00:05:13.680
So I'm going to pick
pink and light blue.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.689
This is going to build
a palette for me.

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:17.480
And you can actually
see a preview up there

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.487
in the top right, and
then down below it,

00:05:19.487 --> 00:05:20.570
there are some hex values.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.759
So I can copy and paste those
hex values into my theme file.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.050
And once I save this, I switch
back over to my browser.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.030
And you can see that now
my header is updated,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.760
the floating action
button is updated,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.470
and even these little lighter
colors over here in my icons

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.560
have been updated.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.490
So really cool.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.960
Just with a tiny
bit of work, we've

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.784
already started theming
this application

00:05:41.784 --> 00:05:43.200
and dropping new
elements into it.

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:48.250
So you've taken your first step
into the world of Polymer 1.0

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.791
and I hope you're
all really excited.

00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:52.140
I'm going to keep digging
into the Starter Kit,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.760
showing off some of the cool
features here on Polycast.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.990

little Subscribe button.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.390
Ask questions down in the
comments if you have them.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.010
AS always, thanks for watching
and I'll see you next time.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.360
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.071
Hey, guys.

00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:04.570
What's up?

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.300
Rob.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.710
The Q&amp;A time.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.260
Todd Judd writes in and
says, "In Polymer 0.5,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.820
you had layout attributes that
came bundled with Polymer.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.100
Those don't seem to be
around in Polymer 1.0,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.760
so what happened to those?

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.230
Good question, Todd.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.280
Around version
Polymer 0.8, 0.9, we

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.120
switched from using
attributes to classes.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.750
And then in 1.0, we actually
took all of those classes

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.870
and we bundled them up
into their own element set

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.540
called Iron Flex Layout.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.810
So you can actually follow
this link right here

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.090
and go to the repo
for Iron Flex Layout.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.580
And inside that repo, we
have custom properties

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.310
that you can apply
to your own elements.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.940
We also have CSS files in
there that you can just

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.690
import into your elements and
use those to get your Flexbox

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.320
layout attributes back, or
layout classes, I should say.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.930
So again, Todd, great question.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.970
Thanks for writing in.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.390
We will send you some swag.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.890
If you have questions
about Polymer,

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.720
leave them down in the comments.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.682
If it's a juicy question,
we will try and feature you.

00:06:59.682 --> 00:07:01.390
As always, thank you
so much for watching

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.700
and I'll see you next time.
