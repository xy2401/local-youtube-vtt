00:00:00.391 --> 00:00:00.890
Hey, guys.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.130
What's up?

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.180
It's Rob Dodson here.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.090
I just wanted to
take this moment

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.800
to thank you all so
much for checking out

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.508
this first season of
"Polycasts" and wish

00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:08.071
you all very happy holidays.

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:10.570
We're going to be going on a
very short break for the winter

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.440
season, but we'll be
back in the new year

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.782
with tons of new content.

00:00:13.782 --> 00:00:15.740
I don't want to leave
you totally empty-handed,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.031
so we've got tons of content
from the Chrome Dev Summit

00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:19.360
which we can now watch today.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.470
It's all available online.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.460
There's about an hour and a
half worth of videos for you

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.300
to check out.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.000
We've got talks from
Dimitri Glazkov,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.487
the godfather of web components.

00:00:26.487 --> 00:00:28.820
He's going to give you the
back story on web components,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.284
and also tell you how to
create reusable components.

00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:33.200
Matt McNulty from the
Polymer Engineering team

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.190
talks about the
roadmap to Polymer 1.0.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.280
And there's also a
talk from yours truly

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.310
about building Polymer
applications, especially

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.672
ones that work well offline.

00:00:40.672 --> 00:00:42.130
And these things
are also available

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.200
down in the video description.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.800
Now, we're also
trying to figure out

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.960
what you would like to
see in the second season

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.700
of "Polycasts."

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.400
So if you follow
this link right here,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.180
we've got a survey
that we put together.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.730
You can tell us what kind of
content you'd like us to make.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.021
So if you're interested in
learning more about testing,

00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:59.490
or performance, or
accessibility, you let us know,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.550
and we'll try to make
that content happen.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.060
Again, it's been a total blast
putting this first season

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.660
together.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.070
I wish you all very happy
holidays and safe travels,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.535
and I'll see you in 2015.
