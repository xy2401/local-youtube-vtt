00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.230
Hey there,
Polycasters, Rob here.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.300
Welcome back to "Ask
Polymer," the show where

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.190
you send in your
hashtag questions,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.830
and we do our best
to answer them.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.300
OK, our first
question today comes

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.260
from Marco, who asks, what
about internationalization?

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.830
Do I have to use an external
JavaScript framework,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.250
or is there some specific
Polymer solution for that?

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.940
So that's a really
good question and one

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.460
that I get all the time.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.350
Right now we have
an element that will

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.740
help with internationalization.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.640
You can check it out over here.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.400
It is called i18n Message.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.370
It was actually written
by Eric Bidelman, one

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.980
of our team members, and
used on a few of our sites.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.370
And basically, the way it
works is you take your text.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.730
You wrap the i18 Message
tag around your text.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.650
And then you give
it a message ID,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.400
which is synced up
with a JSON file

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.490
that loads different
language packs.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.570
So that is one solution
that you can use

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.410
for internationalization today.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.720
It's not the bulletproof perfect
solution for all scenarios,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.650
but it is something
to get you started.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.129
And we're also currently
working on a new set of elements

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.260
called Carbon Elements.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.250
And our hope is that
for those element sets,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.210
we'll be rolling out some
internationalization solutions

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.890
as well.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.954
So thank you for that
awesome question, Marco.

00:01:13.954 --> 00:01:15.370
All right, our
next question comes

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.750
from Sher, who asks, with
the emphasis on mobile,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.760
can ripple and other animations
be turned off for 3G,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.460
and does that matter?

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.500
So that's a really
cool question.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.680
For something like the
paper ripple animation,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.310
you actually can turn
that off on your elements.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.260
You just add a No Ink attribute
to the element itself.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.830
It will disable the ripple.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.880
So for instance, if you
add that to Paper Button,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.124
it'll turn it off.

00:01:38.124 --> 00:01:40.040
Now for something like
mobile, what you can do

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.870
is you can use an
iron media query

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.350
to set up a handler to
check the screen size.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.310
And if it's a
smaller screen, you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.060
can then remove that attribute.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.840
Perhaps if it's a larger
screen, you could add it back.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.740
So that way you could
it have on desktop,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.430
maybe take it away for mobile to
get kind of maximum performance

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.040
there.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.060
As always, you want to be
measuring your performance.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.768
If something does seem
like a bottleneck,

00:01:59.768 --> 00:02:02.350
then, yeah, use a strategy
to try and remove it.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.770
So thank you, Sher, for that
really awesome question.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.270
All right.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.000
Our next question
comes from Mark,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.400
who asks, how do you generate
documentation for elements,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.270
and how do you
document packages?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.770
So to document an element,
what I typically do

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.950
is I start with this thing
called the Seed Element

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.510
Project.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.680
You can check that out
over here on GitHub.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.150
And what that's going to do
is give you a boilerplate

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.370
element as well as,
in the index file,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.285
this thing called
Iron Component Pages.

00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:29.660
And Iron Component
Pages is going

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.350
to read all the comments
in your element itself

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.740
and generate
documentation for you.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.210
Now there's special annotations
that you have to use.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.760
And you can check
out the style guide

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.709
over here, which explains
the different annotations.

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.500
But if you basically
work with that project

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.170
as your starting point
for your new elements,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.980
then you're going to get
documentation basically

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.580
for free.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.900
It's a pretty cool set up.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.070
So definitely check
Seed Element and see

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.450
if that meets your needs.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.080
So thank you, Mark for sending
in that really cool question.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.580
OK.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.190
Our next question
comes from Nicholas,

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.130
who asks, how do you use CSS
Mixins with media queries?

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.420
So that is an
interesting question.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.290
Right now with the current
limitations of the style

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.870
shimming system,
in a media query

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.010
you can consume variables.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.860
However, you can't set new
variables or custom properties.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.310
So what you can do is
use an Iron Media Query

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.570
element to check the
different screen sizes.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.740
And when it's a
smaller screen size,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.230
you can call Polymer's
Update Styles Method

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.320
and actually pass in
new properties that way.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.150
There's actually a
GitHub issue which

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.070
discusses this and
shows an example of how

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.130
you can work around it.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.190
So you can check
that out over here.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.660
And for working with
Mixins, what I can do

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.330
is I can throw together
a little JS bin,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.871
and add that to the
show description.

00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:44.992
So you can see how that
works there as well.

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:46.450
So thank you,
Nicholas, for sending

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.010
in that awesome question.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.381
OK, our last question comes
from Jonathan, who asks,

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:53.380
could you talk a little
bit about the difference

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.210
between paper-listbox
versus paper-menu?

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.320
So, yeah, first of all, way to
have an eagle eye, Jonathan.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.660
And I don't even think
paper-listbox is in our catalog

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.160
yet.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.170
It is up on GitHub, so
you're totally on the ball.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.680
The way that I understand
things is paper-listbox

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.340
is kind of like
the select element

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.160
when you add a multi
attribute to it.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.370
So you get multiple things
that you can choose from.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.940
Perhaps you want to even
choose like one or two items

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.200
at the same time.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.190
However, the paper-menu
is sort of more

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.540
like a traditional
drop-down menu.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.810
So that would be the
difference between those two.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.310
Again, thank you
so much for sending

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.320
in that question, Jonathan.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.380
So that's it for today.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.190
Thank you everyone who sent
in those awesome questions.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.690
If you yourself
have a question, you

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.930
can ping us on a social
network of your choosing

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.320
at #AskPolymer, or leave it for
us down below in the comments.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.070
As always, thank you
so much for watching,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.300
and I'll see you next time.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.050
