[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.230
Polycast 的观众朋友你们好  我是Rob
Hey there, Polycasters, Rob here.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.300
欢迎回到  Ask Polymer
Welcome back to "Ask Polymer," the show where

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.830
你发送打上标签的问题  我们尽力来回答它们
you send in your hashtag questions, and we do our best to answer them.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.300
好了  我们今天的第一个问题
OK, our first question today comes

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.260
来自 Marco  他说  国际化该怎么做
from Marco, who asks, what about internationalization?

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.830
我要引入外部的 JavaScript 框架
Do I have to use an external JavaScript framework,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.250
还是说 Polymer 已经提供了某种解决方案
or is there some specific Polymer solution for that?

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.460
这是个好问题  一直有人问我这个
So that's a really good question and one that I get all the time.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.740
现在我们有了一个帮助国际化的组件
Right now we have an element that will help with internationalization.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.640
你可以点击这里查看
You can check it out over here.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.400
它叫 i18n Message
It is called i18n Message.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.370
由我们团队的一员  Eric Bidelman 写的
It was actually written by Eric Bidelman, one

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.980
已经用在了我们好几个网站上
of our team members, and used on a few of our sites.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.370
从根本上讲  你在你的文本外面
And basically, the way it works is you take your text.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.730
套一个 i18 Message 的标签就可以了
You wrap the i18 Message tag around your text.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.400
然后给它一个消息的ID  通过这个 ID 来装载不同语言包的
And then you give it a message ID, which is synced up with a JSON file

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.490
JSON 文件进行同步
that loads different language packs.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.570
这就是你现在可以使用的
So that is one solution that you can use

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.410
国际化解决方案
for internationalization today.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.720
它并不是所有场景下都表现完美
It's not the bulletproof perfect solution for all scenarios,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.650
但你可以从这里起步
but it is something to get you started.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.129
我们最近还在开发一组叫做
And we're also currently working on a new set of elements

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.260
Carbon Elements 的组件
called Carbon Elements.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.250
我们希望对于这些组件集
And our hope is that for those element sets,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.890
依然会提供一些国际化的解决方案
we'll be rolling out some internationalization solutions as well.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.954
所以谢谢你这个很棒的问题  Marco
So thank you for that awesome question, Marco.

00:01:13.954 --> 00:01:15.370
好了  下一个问题来自 Sher
All right, our next question comes

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.750
他说  对于移动平台
from Sher, who asks, with the emphasis on mobile,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.760
能否在3G网络下关闭波纹和其他特效
can ripple and other animations be turned off for 3G,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.460
这能节省流量吗
and does that matter?

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.500
这个问题很棒
So that's a really cool question.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.680
对于纸张波纹的特效
For something like the paper ripple animation,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.310
你可以在组件中将它关闭
you actually can turn that off on your elements.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.260
只需要在组件中加上一个 No Ink 属性
You just add a No Ink attribute to the element itself.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.830
就可以禁用波纹效果
It will disable the ripple.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.124
比如  你给纸张按钮加上这个属性  就不会有波纹了
So for instance, if you add that to Paper Button, it'll turn it off.

00:01:38.124 --> 00:01:40.040
对于移动端来说  你应该做的是
Now for something like mobile, what you can do

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.870
用 iron-media-query
is you can use an iron media query

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.350
设置一个 handler 来检查屏幕尺寸
to set up a handler to check the screen size.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.060
如果是小屏幕  你可以移除这个属性
And if it's a smaller screen, you can then remove that attribute.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.840
如果是大屏幕  你可以将它加回来
Perhaps if it's a larger screen, you could add it back.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.740
这样你就可以在桌面端有这个特性
So that way you could it have on desktop,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.430
移动端没有  来保证性能的最大化
maybe take it away for mobile to get kind of maximum performance

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.040
there.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.060
和往常一样  你希望测量性能
As always, you want to be measuring your performance.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.768
如果什么东西确实是个阻碍
If something does seem like a bottleneck,

00:01:59.768 --> 00:02:02.350
那么用相应的策略尝试移除它
then, yeah, use a strategy to try and remove it.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.770
谢谢你提出了那么棒的问题  Sher
So thank you, Sher, for that really awesome question.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.270
好了
All right.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.000
下一个问题来自 Mark
Our next question comes from Mark,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.400
他说  你如何为组件生成文档
who asks, how do you generate documentation for elements,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.270
以及文档如何打包
and how do you document packages?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.770
为了写一个组件的文档
So to document an element, what I typically do

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.510
我一般会用 seed-element 这个项目上手
is I start with this thing called the Seed Element Project.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.680
你可以在 GitHub 上查看它
You can check that out over here on GitHub.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.150
它会给你一个样板组件
And what that's going to do is give you a boilerplate

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.370
在 index 文件中的
element as well as, in the index file,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.285
iron-component-page
this thing called Iron Component Pages.

00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:29.660
iron-component-page 它会
And Iron Component Pages is going

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.350
读取你组件中的所有注释
to read all the comments in your element itself

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.740
来为你生成文档
and generate documentation for you.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.210
你需要用到一些特殊的标记
Now there's special annotations that you have to use.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.760
你可以查看这里的样式指南
And you can check out the style guide

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.709
来理解不同的标记
over here, which explains the different annotations.

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.500
但如果你刚开始写组件的时候
But if you basically work with that project

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.170
就使用了那个项目
as your starting point for your new elements,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.580
你可以轻而易举地获得文档
then you're going to get documentation basically for free.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.900
这是个很方便的工具
It's a pretty cool set up.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.450
所以一定要去看看 seed-element 符不符合你的需要
So definitely check Seed Element and see if that meets your needs.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.080
谢谢你 Mark 给出了这个很酷的问题
So thank you, Mark for sending in that really cool question.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.580
好
OK.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.190
下一个问题来自 Nicholas
Our next question comes from Nicholas,

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.130
他说  如何和CSS Mixins 一起使用媒体查询
who asks, how do you use CSS Mixins with media queries?

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.420
这是个很有趣的问题
So that is an interesting question.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.290
现有样式填充系统的缺陷
Right now with the current limitations of the style

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.010
导致在媒体查询中你可以使用已有的变量
shimming system, in a media query you can consume variables.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.860
但你不可以为自定义属性设置新的变量
However, you can't set new variables or custom properties.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.310
所以你可以做的是  用 iron-media-query
So what you can do is use an Iron Media Query

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.570
组件来检查不同的屏幕尺寸
element to check the different screen sizes.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.740
如果是小屏幕的话
And when it's a smaller screen size,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.230
你可以调用 Polymer 的更新样式方法
you can call Polymer's Update Styles Method

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.320
真正传入新的属性
and actually pass in new properties that way.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.150
事实上 GitHub 上有一条 issue
There's actually a GitHub issue which

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.130
就是在讨论这个问题  还提供了一个如何使用的样例
discusses this and shows an example of how you can work around it.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.190
你可以去看一下
So you can check that out over here.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.660
和 Mixins 一起使用的话
And for working with Mixins, what I can do

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.330
我可以做的是将 JS 组装到一起
is I can throw together a little JS bin,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.871
然后加到一段简介上
and add that to the show description.

00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:44.992
你同样可以在这里查看如何使用
So you can see how that works there as well.

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:48.010
谢谢 Nicholas 提出这个很棒的问题
So thank you, Nicholas, for sending in that awesome question.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.381
我们最后一个问题来自 Jonathan
OK, our last question comes from Jonathan, who asks,

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:53.380
他说  你能不能简单地讲一讲
could you talk a little bit about the difference

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.210
paper-listbox 和 paper-menu 的区别
between paper-listbox versus paper-menu?

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.320
好  首先Jonathan  这远没有说到点子上
So, yeah, first of all, way to have an eagle eye, Jonathan.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.160
我甚至完全不认为 paper-listbox 在我们的收录之中
And I don't even think paper-listbox is in our catalog yet.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.170
它在GitHub上  你要承担尝试的风险
It is up on GitHub, so you're totally on the ball.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.680
我理解的方式是 paper-listbox
The way that I understand things is paper-listbox

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.340
是一种选择组件
is kind of like the select element

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.160
你可以在上面添加多个属性
when you add a multi attribute to it.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.370
你有很多个选项可以选择
So you get multiple things that you can choose from.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.940
也许你想同时选择
Perhaps you want to even choose like one or two items

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.200
一个或两个选项
at the same time.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.190
但是  paper-menu 更像是
However, the paper-menu is sort of more

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.540
传统的下拉式菜单
like a traditional drop-down menu.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.810
这会是两者的区别
So that would be the difference between those two.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.320
同样地  感谢你提出这个问题  Jonathan
Again, thank you so much for sending in that question, Jonathan.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.380
今天就到这里
So that's it for today.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.190
谢谢所有提出问题的观众
Thank you everyone who sent in those awesome questions.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.690
如果你有什么问题
If you yourself have a question, you

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.930
在你的社交网络上
can ping us on a social network of your choosing

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.320
用#AskPolymer联系我们  或者在下面留下评论
at #AskPolymer, or leave it for us down below in the comments.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.300
