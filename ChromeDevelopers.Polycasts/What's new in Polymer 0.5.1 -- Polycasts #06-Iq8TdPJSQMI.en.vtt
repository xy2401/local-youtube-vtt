Hey, everyone, what's
up, it's Rob Dodson,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.500
in today's episode
of Polycast, I'm

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.600
going to give you
an overview of what

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.351
has changed in the new
release of Polymer,

00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:08.600
and we're also going to take
a look at one weird trick

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.150
to make it a lot easier to work
with the core drawer panel.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.010
Let's dive in.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.780
So as of a little
over a week ago,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.420
Polymer is now at version
0.5.1 and with that

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.030
comes some pretty
interesting changes.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.450
First and foremost is
the fact that platform.js

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.210
has been renamed to
webcomponents.js.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.630
This is really just to clarify
that the polyfills are just

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.680
for web components and
you can work with them

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.810
without requiring
the rest of Polymer.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.930
Even more concrete, the
team has moved ownership

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.110
of the polyfills from
the Polymer organization

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.350
over to WebComponents.org.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.070
WebComponents.org is
a community-run site

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.540
focused exclusively on the
web component standards,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.680
and does not cater to
any particular library

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.260
or framework.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.540
And Polymer Team will still
be contributing heavily

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.810
to the polyfills, but the
hope is that this makes them

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.290
into more of a shared
resource for everyone.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.390
Another big announcement
is that polymer.html now

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.496
includes the unminified
source for polymer.js.

00:01:00.496 --> 00:01:02.370
In previous versions of
Polymer, if something

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.230
was broken in Polymer itself,
and you needed to debug it,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.440
it looked something like this.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.945
Can you find the bug up in here?

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.020
, Yeah, me neither.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.290
Now in Polymer 0.5.1,
you get the full source,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.217
including comments,
which is very nice.

00:01:19.217 --> 00:01:21.300
So now adding breakpoints
and tracking down errors

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.149
is much, much easier.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.690
And speaking of
tracking down errors,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.856
the Polymer team is also
releasing a new test runner

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:28.023
called web component tester.

00:01:28.023 --> 00:01:30.564
Web component tester was created
to solve the problem of test

00:01:30.564 --> 00:01:32.870
runners that worked great
for JavaScript test,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.300
but not so well for HTML tests.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.050
It comes prepackaged
with Mocha and Chai,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.300
and handful of other
helper libraries.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.804
Tests can be run on any browser
you have locally installed,

00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:43.220
and web component
tester will also

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.980
set up a connection
to Sauce Labs

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.650
so you can run your test on
virtual machines in Windows,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.764
Linux, Mac, and even
iOS and Android.

00:01:50.764 --> 00:01:53.180
Now we're just barely scratching
the surface of everything

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.764
that's in the 0.5.1 release.

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:56.180
If you head over
the Polymer blog,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.710
there is a full post
explaining it all,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.130
and you can follow
this link right here

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.807
to check it out yourself.

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:05.390
All right, now I
know I keep promising

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.340
to show you this one weird
trick to make the core drawer

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.090
panel much more awesome, so
let's dive into our code editor

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.132
and we'll check that out.

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:13.298
The first thing we're going
to do in our code editor

00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:15.550
is open our Bower JSON file
and change any reference

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.480
to 0.4.2 over to 0.5.1.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.657
Then in my terminal, I'm
going to run bower install

00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:23.240
to pull down all
those new components.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.550
And back in my editor, I'm
going to change platform.js

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.550
to 0.2 webcomponents.js.

00:02:33.378 --> 00:02:35.590
Then I want to go down
to the icon button

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.750
that we wrote out last
time, and we're actually

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.950
going to replace its ID with a
core drawer toggle attribute.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.740
And this is a new feature of
the 0.5.1 version of the drawer

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.880
panel, and it's going
to automatically make

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.377
our menu button control the
sliding behavior of our drawer.

00:02:51.377 --> 00:02:53.960
That means we can take all this
JavaScript we wrote last time,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.450
and just delete it.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.440
And we can also take this bit
of CSS that we wrote down here,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.373
and get rid of that as well.

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:05.271
Now over in our browser, if we
start to re-size the page down,

00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:07.520
you'll see that we still get
that icon button up there

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.250
in the top left, and
if we click on it,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.220
it's still going to slide
the drawer panel out,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.553
except this time, we didn't
have to write any JavaScript

00:03:13.553 --> 00:03:16.536
or CSS to make that happen,
which I think is pretty hot.

00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:18.270
All right, for those of you who
have been watching the series

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.770
so far, I know
you're really itching

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.102
to get some content inside
of this application.

00:03:22.102 --> 00:03:24.560
To do that, we're going to need
to understand routing, data

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.370
binding, and the
core pages element.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.650
That's going to be the focus
of our upcoming episode.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.733
So I really hope you stick
around for all of that.

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:32.230
As always, thanks for watching.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.330
I'll see you next time.
