MALE SPEAKER:
Polycast 43, take one.

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:06.930
ROB DODSON: Hey there,
Polycasters, Rob here.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.490
Welcome back to the show.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.560
Last week we were
doing this thing called

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.770
"Ask Polymer," where we
take questions from you,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.280
and then we try to answer them
here on the YouTube channel.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.430
And as we were collecting
those questions,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.760
I noticed a lot of
folks were asking,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.330
when's the Polymer team
going to create a data table?

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.005
Or, what is the road map
for this particular element

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:27.440
and stuff like that?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.334
And as we were going
through that process,

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:31.750
I really started to think that
if web components are going

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.050
to be successful, we're
going to have to scale

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.840
beyond the Polymer team.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.940
Really, it's going
to be up to all of us

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.910
out here in the community
to start making cool stuff,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.204
sharing it with one another, and
also like promoting it, right?

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:45.870
So one of the things
that I wanted to do

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.010
was, here on this show, I want
to start a new segment called

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.690
#BuiltWithPolymer, where I take
all the cool stuff that you're

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.230
building, and we
just show it off

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.490
so other folks can get
involved with the projects

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.520
and start using it in
their own applications.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.410
Now, to do this, we're
going to start off

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.670
by looking at a website
called customelements.io.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.980
I'm curious, show of
hands, how many of you

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.180
have seen
customelements.io before?

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.170
[CHEERING]

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.060
OK, I noticed that you did
not raise your hand, sir.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.481
So for you and for
other folks like you,

00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.730
I want to just walk you
through how this website works

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.730
and some of the cool
stuff that's on there.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.813
So if you haven't seen it
before customelements.io

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:23.700
is pretty bad ass.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.490
You can think of it kind of like
[? MPM ?] for web components.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.117
It's sort of a registry.

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:29.950
It collects all the
things that are actually

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.366
in the Bower
registry, and then it

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.190
displays little bits
of info about it.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.010
So you can search, and you can
find the different components

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.140
that are out there.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.890
You go to the website,
and the first thing

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.820
that you're going to see up here
are these three main sections.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.840
You've got the stuff
that is recently created.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.160
It's brand new.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.980
You've got the things that have
been recently updated, which

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.990
I always like to see.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.312
That's supposed to be a clock.

00:01:50.312 --> 00:01:52.020
And then you've also
got the stuff that's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.530
the most popular
elements out there,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.600
so the things with
the most GitHub stars.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.810
All three of these,
very useful categories

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.492
to kind of keep tabs on.

00:02:00.492 --> 00:02:02.200
And one of things that
I also really like

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.810
is you've got this really huge
search field up at the top.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.320
Now, anything that
you could kind of

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.639
imagine needing a component
for you can just go type.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.270
So I might say, oh, I want
something like a table.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.000
So go type in
table, and now I've

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.080
got all of these cool
results popping up here

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.250
for various kinds of tables.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.240
Another thing that
customelements.io gives you,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.489
which is pretty awesome, is
at any point, if you want,

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.490
you can click on
someone's profile photo,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.580
and this will show you not only
their profile page, but also

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.114
all the cool
elements that they've

00:02:33.114 --> 00:02:35.530
produced in addition to that
one that you were looking at.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.010
So if you think someone's making
some really high-quality stuff,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.230
you can kind of stalk them
on a customelements.io

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.020
and see what else
they're making.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.530
Going back to where we were
last week, a lot of folks

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.550
were asking, when is
the Polymer team going

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.895
to create a date picker in
the Material Design style?

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:52.470
Now, this is something
that is not currently

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.356
on the Polymer
team's to-do list.

00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:56.230
We have a lot of elements
that we've created.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.105
And right now what we
really want to focus on

00:02:58.105 --> 00:03:00.430
is polishing those, closing
bugs, and making sure

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.910
that they work really well.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.640
So at the moment,
no one is actively

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.690
working on a paper date picker,
and that, for a lot of folks,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.005
is sort of a dilemma.

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:09.830
But if we go to
customelements.io,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.413
we go to the search
field, we can just

00:03:11.413 --> 00:03:14.200
type in date picker,
or just date, whatever.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.804
And we can see right
here, right away,

00:03:15.804 --> 00:03:17.720
we've got this paper
date picker that shows up

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.140
by this guy named Ben Davis.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.530
So let's scope that out.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.090
And looking at the Component
page on customelements.io,

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.190
we get a lot of information
really quick right here.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.700
So I can see, for instance, how
many stars this component has.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.670
I can see how many
people have forked it

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.540
and how many people are
watching the issues on it.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.390
I also get the one-liner
to install this on Bower.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.590
And what I think is maybe one
of the most important aspects

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.590
of the site, I get this
Activity panel here.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.740
And on the Activity panel I
can see that the component

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.440
was created a year ago.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.020
And most importantly, I can
see that it was last updated 11

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.250
days ago, which tells
me that this is still

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.880
being actively developed.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.557
People are contributing
to this thing.

00:04:02.557 --> 00:04:03.390
They're patching it.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.360
They're fixing bugs.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.100
And it's getting a
lot of love right now,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.766
which is important
for anything that I'm

00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:09.580
going to add to my application.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.586
Also, we've got the list
of Bower dependencies

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:13.960
down here on the
right-hand side.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.640
And again, it's really
valuable because I

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.181
want to know that, hey, is this
thing depending on the latest

00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:21.510
version of Polymer, or at least
Polymer 1.0 and some version

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.440
above that?

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.230
I don't want an element that
is Polymer 0.5 or Polymer

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.450
0.3 or anything.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.520
That's just not going
to work in my app.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.077
So having all of
this information

00:04:30.077 --> 00:04:31.910
just kind of at your
disposal every time you

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.326
go check out one
of these elements

00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:36.230
is a huge, huge benefit
and one of the main reasons

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.105
why I think everyone should
be using customelements.io.

00:04:39.105 --> 00:04:40.480
Now, the other
thing that it does

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.540
is it slurps in the
README for this element.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.390
So you can see here
on the left I've

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.430
got kind of the GitHub
README that's just

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.120
been pulled into the website.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.460
And, if you want, you can
go down here and click

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.040
on the Component
page, and this is

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.804
going to give you the classic
Polymer [? dox ?] style, right?

00:04:57.804 --> 00:04:59.220
You've probably
seen these before,

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.470
where you can see properties
that an element supports.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.604
You can see the methods
that it supports as well.

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:06.020
One of the things that I noticed
was not showing up here--

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.519
usually, up in the
top-right corner,

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:08.900
there's a little Demo button.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.620
It's not showing
up on this page,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.010
but we can just add that by
typing Demo into the URL bar.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.362
And now, ta-da, we've got our
paper date picker showing up.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.570
And you can see, this thing
looks pretty nice, right?

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.430
I can go click around
different dates.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.950
Changing the month gives me
these sort of cool Material

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.090
Design ripple effects.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.250
Close it, and then I can
click this button again

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.619
to show you how it reopens.

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:35.660
Lastly, one of the things
that's really important

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.120
is making sure that the
date picker is responsive.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.080
So I go grab the
corner of my browser,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.680
start shrinking the
page, and then, boom,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.340
you can see that it has changed
its layout, which is really,

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.390
really good for mobile devices.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.890
So that is just one element
that Ben Davis has produced.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.190
If you go back to his
profile on customelements.io,

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.255
you can see that he's got
a few other items here--

00:05:57.255 --> 00:06:00.780
a paper chip, paper time picker,
slightly different from a date

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.300
picker, paper
full-screen dialog.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.340
A lot of really
interesting looking

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.360
stuff there that
hopefully we can show off

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.990
in a future episode.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.500
So go find some elements
on customelements.io.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.100
Go find the authors, stalk them.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.410
Stalk them on GitHub.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.660
Don't stalk them in real life.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.510
But stalk them on GitHub
and on this website

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.260
so you can keep tabs
on all the cool stuff

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.360
that they're building.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.901
Another thing that
happened last week

00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:22.260
was a lot of folks were
asking, when's the Polymer team

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.130
going to create a
data table, something

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.260
that is really sophisticated
that I can filter,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.830
where I can rearrange columns,
and do all sorts of stuff

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.397
like that?

00:06:29.397 --> 00:06:31.230
Honestly, again, this
is one of those things

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.061
that it's such a
big undertaking,

00:06:33.061 --> 00:06:34.560
no one on the Polymer
team currently

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.520
has it on their to-do list.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.740
Because building a
complex data table,

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.970
you could seriously just
found a company just

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.660
on making a killer data table.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.900
And, in fact, there's a group of
folks who have done just that.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.864
So recently, a
team called Vaadin

00:06:48.864 --> 00:06:50.530
released a set of
elements which they're

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.390
calling Vaadin Elements.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.740
And very similar to the
product lines of the Polymer

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.948
team [? vends, ?] things
like iron elements and paper

00:06:56.948 --> 00:06:58.270
elements, they put out the set.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.100
And the Vaadin Elements are
split into two categories.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.160
You've got these
business-oriented elements

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.700
for things like data
tables and combo boxes.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.650
They've even created an icon
set of kind of business-y icons.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.180
Then they've also got a
bunch of data visualization

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.330
components, Vaadin Charts.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.410
Now, the core elements,
as they call them,

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.700
these sort of
business layout ones,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.169
these are all free
and open source.

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:25.710
They are Apache licensed, so
you can use them in your project

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.290
today.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.860
And then the Chart
Elements, those

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.600
are a commercial license,
which you have to pay for.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.850
But since a lot of you were
asking about data tables,

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.200
I thought this would
be a really good one

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.180
to highlight because
it's available on GitHub,

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.180
and you can mess around
with it and use it today

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.236
in your project for free.

00:07:40.236 --> 00:07:41.860
So if you go to their
website, which is

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.000
at vaadin.com/elements, you've
got this little Demo button.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.450
And if we click that, it's going
to show us this cool Expense

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.455
Manager Application.

00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:53.390
So I'm going to scope out
the live demo for this puppy.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.960
And we've got a
really, really nice

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.900
looking experience here, so
kind of classic table layout--

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.460
columns and headers.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.680
What I really like
about this is there's

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.940
these filters up at the top.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.930
So I can just go and check
some of these values.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.850
And, for instance, checking
in progress and reimburse,

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.660
you can see over here the
amount of items in the table

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.025
is changing as I'm
changing these values.

00:08:18.025 --> 00:08:19.400
You can sort of
see them changing

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.300
over here as well on the left.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.410
We can also look for
different merchants.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.740
So I could say, oh, I
just want to see stuff

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.020
from the Taxi
merchant for instance,

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.950
and we'll just get
only the expenses

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.020
related to that category.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.829
Likewise, we can search
by min and max values,

00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:36.370
a lot of cool things
you can do here.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.570
They've even got this little
floating action button

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.090
down here at the bottom.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.230
So you can use that
to open a dialog

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.735
and actually add a new
expense to this table--

00:08:44.735 --> 00:08:47.560
a really, really cool
example, really, really cool,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.280
powerful element.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.030
It's one of those
things that, again, it's

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.470
not on the Polymer team's
agenda at the moment to build,

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.410
but here you've got this awesome
community-built project which

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.480
we can all start
using in our own work.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.320
So, yeah, that about
covers it for today.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.850
I know I've only shown
a couple elements,

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.891
but there's actually a
big, long list of elements

00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:07.160
that I want to start
featuring on this show.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.050
But before I get
into that, if you

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.010
out there, if you've got some
stuff that you've built which

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.280
you would like for us to show
off-- it can be elements,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.363
it could just be cool
projects that you've built--

00:09:15.363 --> 00:09:18.270
please leave me a comment down
there in the YouTube comments,

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.079
or you can ping me on
Twitter at #BuiltWithPolymer.

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:23.370
That about covers it for today.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.936
So, as always, thank you
so much for watching,

00:09:25.936 --> 00:09:27.060
and I'll see you next time.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.498
Ready?

00:09:32.498 --> 00:09:36.250
MALE SPEAKER: 43 take
two, [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.720
ROB DODSON: Hey there,
Polycasters, Rob here.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.630
[BLEEP] Kind of
pause for a second.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.826
Oh, Twitter notifications.
