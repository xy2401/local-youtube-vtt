PAUL LEWIS: Hello, and welcome
to this "Supercharged TL;DW."

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.050
Last week, Summer and
I built a 3D card flip.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.570
Let me show you what
we got to building.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.810
So you can see I've got
this card on screen.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.710
And when I click on it,
it flips over in 3D.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.280
And there are
shadows and all sorts

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.465
of things underneath as well
to make it look just right.

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:28.840
Now, the other
thing I've done is

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.370
I've taken a timeline recording.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.203
And you can see that
it's hitting a comfy 60

00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:32.950
frames a second.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.033
And it probably would--
well, it is doing the same

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:37.260
on most mobile devices as well.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.707
So with that said, let
me show you actually

00:00:39.707 --> 00:00:40.790
how we got to building it.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.820
And of course, that requires a
trip to the most famous corner

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.900
of them all-- Theory Corner.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.700
Hello, my theoretical chums.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.030
Welcome to Theory Corner.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.896
So let's do a little bit
of 3D theory-- not loads.

00:00:55.896 --> 00:00:56.770
Don't worry about it.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.070
It's not that bad.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.800
So imagine we have our
axes-- x, y, and zed--

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.870
or z, depending on
what you prefer.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.380
And imagine our screen is at the
front here and so is the card.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.750
Now, what we need to do is
we need to push the card back

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.380
into z space so
that it's got space

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.420
to come forward and flip
over and go back again.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.890
So we push it back in z space.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.780
Now, the way we do that
is we put perspective

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.863
on the containing element.

00:01:20.863 --> 00:01:23.760
And the perspective value
is always in pixels,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.930
according to the spec--
or mostly is, anyway.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.890
And so we push this
card back, say,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.350
by 200 pixels or something.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.360
And when we do that, we find
that the card gets smaller,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.690
as it does in real life.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.240
The further things are away from
us, the smaller they appear.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.337
So that's fair enough.

00:01:38.337 --> 00:01:40.670
But we don't want the card
to appear small, necessarily.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.461
We just want it to
start at its actual size

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:44.900
but be 200 pixels away from it.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.500
So what we do is we
look at the spec.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.999
And it says, well, in order to
figure out how much something

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.360
has been scaled down, you
take the perspective value,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.010
and you divide it by
perspective minus the distance

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.930
that you've moved your thing.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.430
So let's say we've
got a perspective

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.000
value of 500 pixels.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.690
To figure out what we need to
do for the scaling of this card,

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.980
we say 500 over 500
minus minus 200,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.760
because we moved it
minus 200 pixels in z.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.949
That tells us that
we've got to scale down.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.332
It's scaled down by 0.71.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.790
Well, we want to
scale it up, so we

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.280
have to do 1 over that value.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.000
So we can scale it by 1
over 0.71, which works out

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.770
to a very convenient 1.4.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.147
So now our card is scaled up.

00:02:23.147 --> 00:02:24.980
What we can do is we
can set up an animation

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.497
to bring it forward, flip it
over, and push it back again.

00:02:28.497 --> 00:02:29.830
So that's just the 3D card flip.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.310
We'll talk about the shadows and
so on when we get to the code.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.540
In fact, talking of code,
let's go and look at some.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.465
Welcome back to the codey bit.

00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:43.207
Now what we'll do is we'll have
a look at some of this code.

00:02:43.207 --> 00:02:44.790
In fact, let's look
at the HTML first.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.384
We have an SC card.

00:02:46.384 --> 00:02:47.300
It's a custom element.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.570
We normally do this.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.710
It's just for convenience
and because it's actually

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.030
quite handy to do that.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.220
You don't have to do that.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.780
It would work just fine
if you had divs and so on.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.650
And for now, we can
ignore the attributes

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.710
that we've added on here.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.980
The main thing is we've got this
front and we've got this back.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.910
And in fact, if we look at the
styles for this front and back,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.499
mostly it's just going
to be absolute position

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:12.540
and so on, because we want
the front and the back

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.081
to appear over the
top of each other.

00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.120
But the super
interesting bit, I think,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.110
is the back face
visibility set to hidden.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.920
We do this because
we want to make sure

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.597
that even if the two
halves of the card

00:03:23.597 --> 00:03:25.180
are placed over the
top of each other,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.472
if one has got its back to
us, we don't see it anymore.

00:03:27.472 --> 00:03:29.555
And that's actually a
really important thing here.

00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:31.600
We need to make sure
that only the side that

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.110
is facing towards
us as the camera

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.980
is the one that's
actually visible,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.530
so we switch back
face visibility

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.480
to hidden for the front
and the back of the cards.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.880
Now, when it comes
to the JavaScript,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.320
most of the time, most of this
code is fairly boilerplate,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.560
I suppose, except for
this actual flip function,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.212
which is the meat of what
we actually get into.

00:03:54.212 --> 00:03:55.420
So let's have a look at that.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.721
Now, what we're doing is we're
setting up-- first of all,

00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:01.220
we're setting up this scale,
which we talked about over here

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.310
in Theory Corner.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.790
We need to know how much our
card needs to be scaled up by.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.720
Now, I've hardcoded these
values, a more generalized

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.220
version.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.790
You take the actual
dimensions yourself,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.860
and you'd figure out
exactly what you need to do.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.110
I'm not going to do that in
this particular situation,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.250
but you can do that.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.170
Because what we said over
there, it's actually--

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.070
I've inverted it.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.460
So rather than it being
500 over 500 plus 200,

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.070
I've actually done
500 plus 200 over 500.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.951
That's going to give
us the 1.4 value here.

00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:31.450
OK.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.110
With the scaling done, let's
talk about side 2 and side 2.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.830
Now, the card could be
with its back facing to us

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.980
or its front facing to us, so we
just call it side 1 and side 2.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.770
And we just choose
whichever one of these

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.353
is going to make sense depending
on whether the card is facing

00:04:44.353 --> 00:04:46.924
us on one side or the other.

00:04:46.924 --> 00:04:49.090
Side 1, side 2-- they're
pretty much the same thing.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.700
They're an array of key
frames, and each key frame

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.014
is an object.

00:04:53.014 --> 00:04:54.680
And in this case, we
have the transform.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.315
So let's step through
what we do for side 1.

00:04:57.315 --> 00:04:58.690
Basically, what
we're saying here

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.436
is we're going to push it back
200 pixels, like we discussed.

00:05:01.436 --> 00:05:03.310
We're going to set its
rotation to 0 degrees,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.018
and we're going to
scale it up so that it

00:05:05.018 --> 00:05:06.390
looks at the correct size.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.680
Then we bring the card
forward by 100 pixels,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.810
and we leave the
rotation where it is

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.870
and the scale where
it is as well.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.370
Next keyframe, we're going
to be still at minus 100,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.500
but this time, we're going to
rotate the card across the x-

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.830
or the y-axis, depending on
which one we want to use,

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.610
by 180 degrees.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.350
And then finally, we're
going to push the card back

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.770
to minus 200 pixels in z space.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.950
Side 2 is pretty
much the same thing,

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.270
except that instead of
going from 0 to 180 degrees,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.730
it's going from 180
degrees to 360 degrees.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.297
So we know that's going to
work for us, because basically,

00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:42.880
we've got back face
visibility hidden.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.320
We've got one card that's
180 degrees and one

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.010
side of the card
that says 0 degrees.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.977
And we will just
basically choose

00:05:49.977 --> 00:05:52.560
which one needs to be side 1 and
which one needs to be side 2.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.720
And you can see
that is down here.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.280
If the card is on
its front side,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.400
we're going to animate
front as side 1.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.720
If it's on its back, then front
will be animated as side 2.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.110
So we basically hot-swap
between those two.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.330
So that gives us the
card flipping over,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.701
and that works just great.

00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:12.450
Let's have a quick
chat about the shadows.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.158
Now, I'm not going to
spend a lot of time

00:06:14.158 --> 00:06:16.670
on this, because we spent
a good amount of time

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.500
on the livestream.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.070
And if you've got
a spare hour, it's

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.970
definitely worth
your time, this one.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.190
There's loads of really
interesting bits and pieces

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.540
in there about why we can't
use a blur filter, why

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.747
we can't use box shadow.

00:06:27.747 --> 00:06:29.080
There's loads of stuff in there.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.770
But if you can't
watch the livestream,

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.603
there is actually an
accompanying blog post.

00:06:32.603 --> 00:06:35.090
We'll put an annotation or put
it in the description below.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.170
Have a read at that.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.930
It really does get into
9-slicing, and using SVG,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.420
and how it is we're
actually going

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.910
to do a performance
shadow that's

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.340
disconnected from the element
that it's actually shadowing.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.160
It's really an
interesting technique.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.450
What we have, though,
is we have two shadows.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.160
We have what I'm calling
the umbra and the penumbra.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.370
And the umbra is the
really tight shadow

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.780
with a little bit of blur.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.335
And it looks like this.

00:07:02.335 --> 00:07:03.960
It's got a little
bit of blur, and it's

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.210
SVG, which you can see here.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.900
It's SVG with a Gaussian
blur with a deviation of 2.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.850
And we just have
a black rectangle

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.550
that's been blurred by it.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.220
The penumbra is a
blurry version again.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.760
And it's got a blur of,
I think, 12 pixels on it.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.770
And what we do is we actually
fade from one to the other.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.720
So when the card is
like this and it's

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.330
at the back of--
200 pixels back,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.890
we use that very tight and less
blurry version of the shadow.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.790
Watch closely as we
do the animation.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.750
We fade from that to the
penumbra, the blurrier version.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.990
And that is exactly what
we'd expect in real life.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.150
As something gets further
away from a plane,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.484
its shadow is going to
get blurrier and bigger.

00:07:47.484 --> 00:07:49.400
And so that's what we're
trying to mimic here.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.775
And it's a subtle
thing, but it's

00:07:50.775 --> 00:07:54.060
going to give it the
feeling of reality.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.840
And the code for it
is very, very much

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.460
the same as the other stuff.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.740
We have an umbra and a
penumbra, and we fade.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.090
You can see not only do we do
the rotation stuff that we were

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:09.790
doing before, we translate the
shadows down and then back up

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.510
again.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.010
And we also fade the opacity.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.670
So you can see that the
smaller, tighter, less blurry

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.000
version goes from 0.3 to
0 and then back up to 0.3,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.250
and the blurrier one
follows it, moves

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.420
in exactly the same way,
same rotation, and so on,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.500
but it goes from 0 to 0.5
and then back down again.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.100
So it's crossfading
between those two shadows

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.870
to give us that effect.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.840
And finally, finally, finally,
right at the end of this,

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.570
we have the animation
call for the pair of them.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.610
And when the penumbra-- the
blurry one, when it's finished

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.220
animating, we basically
unlock the card

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.262
so that people can tap on it
again, and we flip the side.

00:08:45.262 --> 00:08:46.970
We know that we've
flipped the card over,

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.840
so now we just say if
you're on the front,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.650
you're now on your back.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.816
And if you're on your back,
you're now on the front.

00:08:51.816 --> 00:08:54.546
And that is basically
all that goes into this.

00:08:54.546 --> 00:08:55.420
So there you have it.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.600
That's how you can
make a 3D card flip.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.640
You can check out the
blog post on the shadow

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.200
stuff and 9-slicing, really
interesting stuff there.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.892
You can have a watch
at the livestream.

00:09:05.892 --> 00:09:06.850
That was about an hour.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.720
And as I say, it's got loads
of super cool stuff in there.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.090
Definitely worth your time.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.190
And of course, you can
subscribe to this show.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.780
You can subscribe
to this channel,

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.870
and you'll find loads
of amazing content.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.075
They're definitely
worth checking out,

00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:21.480
[INAUDIBLE] with Rob Dodson.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.480
I didn't have time to
talk about the inert stuff

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.390
that we're using here,
but that's super cool.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.681
Definitely check out that show.

00:09:26.681 --> 00:09:30.250
And I will catch you with
[INAUDIBLE] next time.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.930
Don't forget that
you can subscribe.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.060
One of those two will work.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.450
Or you can watch the livestream.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.800
And I am not going
anywhere until you

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.183
do one of those two things.

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:44.860
I'm still here.
