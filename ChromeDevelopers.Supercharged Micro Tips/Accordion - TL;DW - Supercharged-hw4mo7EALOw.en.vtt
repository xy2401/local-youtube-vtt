[MUSIC PLAYING] [EXPLOSION]

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.140
PAUL LEWIS: Hello, and welcome
to this Supercharged TL;DW.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.280
Last time, [? Sermer ?]
and I made an accordion.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.560
Not the musical kind.
[ACCORDION NOISES] That

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.930
would be weird.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.340
No, instead, what we
made was a UI element.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.116
Let's take a look
at what we made.

00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:25.490
So you can see on
screen here, we

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.880
have a bunch of panels--
one, two, three.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.090
And you can see that
they're sliding up and down.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.130
Now you can also use
your keyboard as well.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.344
Tab, and arrow keys,
and so forth as well.

00:00:37.344 --> 00:00:39.010
Let's also look at
the performance side.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.460
I've the timeline here
in Dev Tools open.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.717
If I click around
these panels, you'll

00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:47.050
see that each one of those
clicks, there's an animation.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.390
And if we zoom in, it's a
comfortable 60 frames a second.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.430
Lovely and green.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.850
No red markers there.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.100
Working really well.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.190
So how do we make it?

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.980
Well, as we get into
that, of course,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.311
there's only one place to
go for this discussion.

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:00.810
Yes.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.630
Yes.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.190
Theory Corner.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.430
Hello, my friends.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.180
Welcome to Theory Corner.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.750
Now, here's our set this time.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.875
We have a bunch of panels.

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:12.500
And, by default, what
we're going to do

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.660
is we're going to
leave those well alone.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.480
Sounds odd.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.170
But if JavaScript
doesn't run, we

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.670
don't want to lose this content.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.660
So we're going to
style based on the fact

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.360
that JavaScript is running.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.350
So if JavaScript isn't
running for some reason,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.180
these panels will just stack up.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.850
OK?

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.480
If JavaScript is
running, we're going

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.020
to set a flag on
the element, which

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.300
is going to cause the panels to
rejig into this format, where

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.795
we have them kind of
stacked up like this.

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.420
And the other things
that we need to do

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.120
is, as you click
on a panel header,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.640
we're going to slide
that panel into place.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.690
For this to also work,
we want to make sure

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.300
that all content that's kind
of outside this box is hidden.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.970
So we use overflow:hidden.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.880
And we want to make sure
that the content itself only

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.780
takes up this amount of room.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.320
And anything that's longer than
that would need a scroll bar.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.060
Fair enough.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.560
OK.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.430
Let's go and have
a look at the code.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.130
Welcome back.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.540
Let's look at the code.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.250
Have you ever noticed
how you never have

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.139
heavy metal and an accordion?

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.350
[ACCORDION NOISES]
Never works out.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.090
So let's look at
the code itself.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.964
Now, the code is quite
interesting overall.

00:02:16.964 --> 00:02:18.380
And if you've got
time, definitely

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.296
watch that Livestream.

00:02:19.296 --> 00:02:21.576
It's about an hour
long, but there's bugs

00:02:21.576 --> 00:02:23.700
and there's loads of stuff
and loads of discussion.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.519
Some brilliant questions
from the people

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.560
who are watching Livestream,
so it's really worth

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.601
catching that if you can.

00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:30.970
But there are main things
that we can dive into

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.721
and actually have
a proper look at.

00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:34.720
And the main thing that
I think we'll start with

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.880
is the attached call back.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.910
We're using custom elements
here for the accordion

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.694
and the panes.

00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:41.110
You see that
actually in the HTML.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.220
Let's have a look there quickly.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.150
There's the accordion.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.960
Tada.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.670
And then each of those panes
is in there with a header

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.439
button and the content itself.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.980
So let's look at
the accordion again.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.840
So when it gets
attached, what we do

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.759
is we ask for all
the panes, and then

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:54.925
we calculate the geometries.

00:02:54.925 --> 00:03:00.790
And the geometries is basically
how tall is the header.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.960
OK?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.300
And then we figure out
the available height

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.310
based on the total height of
the accordion minus the number

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.340
of headers we've got.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.490
And that's the amount of
content space that we've got.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.845
When we move the panels
around and we set up

00:03:13.845 --> 00:03:15.220
everything, what
we want to do is

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.870
we want to make sure that we
reset the pane content height

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.170
to be that available height.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.484
So you see over
there, the flower?

00:03:24.484 --> 00:03:25.650
That's the available height.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.720
That's where that bit is.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.678
So we want to make sure
that all our panes have

00:03:28.678 --> 00:03:30.670
that available height.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.030
Perfect.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.500
When we see a pane that has
the area expanded attribute,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.506
then we jump down.

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:37.880
Because that's
the expanded pane.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.310
So we need to make sure that
all of the other content

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.300
stacks up below it.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.120
Fair enough.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.310
All good.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.580
So we've done that, and
the calculate geometries,

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.122
move panels.

00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:47.580
Then we set up some
event listeners

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.620
for handling clicks and
handling other things.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.470
And then we basically set this
attribute, which is active.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.610
And that means that
the accordion is now

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.680
ready for business.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.610
And we can get going.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.590
But maybe you're
wondering how, in fact, do

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.452
you do the bit where
you click on a header

00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:04.410
or you select it with a
keyboard and hit Enter.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.520
What happens then?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.460
Glad you asked.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.070
Here to answer your
questions indeed.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.070
So we have to jump over to the
SC pane JavaScript for that.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.079
And all we have in here, really
apart from a couple of getters,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.239
is this attach callback.

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.720
And when you click on the
header inside one of the panes,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.430
we dispatch a custom event.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.680
Now, if you've never come
across custom events before,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.760
they're brilliant.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.220
What they do is they
act like a normal event,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.580
except that you get to name
it and you get to set things

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.540
like whether it bubbles,
or it's cancellable,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.650
all that kind stuff.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.030
Here we're using one
called Panel Change.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.960
And we're going to say
that it's bubbling up

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.418
through the dom, which is great
because we want to delegate

00:04:41.418 --> 00:04:44.830
the handling of the panel change
up to the accordion element

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.780
itself.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.840
Which you will notice
in the event listeners.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.180
Event listeners here,
there's this panel change.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.070
Same name, great.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.670
And then there's this stop
on panel change, which

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.200
involves basically
stepping through all

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.450
the available panes, turn
them all to collapse,

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.000
and then finding the one
that you actually selected,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.520
and telling that one to expand.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.590
Last but not least, we then
call Move Panels again.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.015
And Move Panels is going to
basically tell all the panels

00:05:13.015 --> 00:05:13.890
where they should be.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:20.370
And, basically, by the power
of transitions on transforms,

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.030
what will happen is, as you tell
a pane to be translate y, 200

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.550
pixels, it's going to go up down
the screen, which ultimately

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.530
gives you the effect
that we saw before.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.780
So we're basically sliding
panels around the screen.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.975
Performed really well.

00:05:33.975 --> 00:05:34.850
So there you have it.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.370
A prototype of an accordion
that is performance and has

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.160
a really good foundation for
something like accessibility.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.530
Now don't forget that you
can subscribe to the channel,

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.590
and you can watch
the Livestream.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.110
It's about an hour
long, but there's

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.270
loads in there-- great
discussions, bugs, bug fixes,

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.330
whole heap of things.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.690
And I will catch you,
of course, next time.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.344
Now, I know it
looks a bit strange.

00:05:59.344 --> 00:06:01.440
Just click it and subscribe.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.680
Also Livestream, over there,
that's worth watching, bugs

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.310
and everything.
