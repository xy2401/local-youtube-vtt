You may have heard about a new feature
in JavaScript called async/await

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.960
it's a great way to work with promises
because it makes asynchronous code look

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.160
like regular synchronous code which is
easier to understand in this example

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.359
we're fetching two parts of a page
separately we've got a blog post and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.680
we've got some comments we can change
this to use async await pretty easily

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.910
we await on each fetch so that we can
use the results without having to nest

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.340
in callbacks much easier to read but you
might notice that I've made a fairly

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
common mistake I've accidentally changed
the behavior of the code so things don't

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.860
happen in parallel anymore in the
original code you can see that both of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.070
the fetch calls happen in the outer
function and they get resolved

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.420
independently in whatever order they
finish but in the new code the await on

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.260
the first fetch means that nothing else
will happen until it resolves including

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.980
the second fetch you can fix this pretty
easily by moving the await since

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.820
laughter both promises have been started
so we hold on to the promises from each

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.379
fetch and await on the values when we
actually need them and there you have it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.770
both fetches can happen in parallel
again an async await still makes the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.540
code look much simpler so you may notice
I'm not server but don't worry I'm just

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.990
here doing a guest tip if you'd like to
watch previous episode the server in it
