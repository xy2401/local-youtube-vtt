00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.850
SURMA: Custom properties
are a new addition to CSS.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.200
They are better known
under a different name--

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.000
CSS variables.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.750
In the past, web developers
have used preprocessors

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.360
like Sass, LESS, or Stylus
to have this functionality.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.560
The advantage of using the
standardized custom properties

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.230
is that you can change the
values during runtime using

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.540
media queries,
JavaScript, or dev tools,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.600
and immediately see the
effect of your changes.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.100
With this in place,
it makes sense

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.430
to make a lot of your values
dependent on custom properties.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.410
In this example, the
size of the ribbon,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.510
as well as the ribbon
flap, have been

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.430
defined using custom
properties, and are

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.560
used in many calc
expressions to position

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.480
and size other elements.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.460
I can change these
properties in dev tools

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.490
to find the ideal
value for my layout.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.340
It's especially useful to
define a padding variable that

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.890
is used as a base unit
whenever you're defining

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.230
a gutter, margin, or padding.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.820
This way, you have
a single lever

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.210
to make a design feel
more or less spacious.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.839
More patterns will
probably evolve

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.630
in the near future
around custom properties

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.250
as they become best practice.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.620
But even now, they are
widely supported and allow

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.410
you to make rapid changes and
keep your design much more

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.310
flexible.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.510
Good stuff, isn't it?

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.650
See you next time.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.810
I mean, we all know that
Supercharged is clearly

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.000
the best, but we do
other series as well

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.322
which you should totally watch.

00:01:19.322 --> 00:01:21.030
And for that reason,
you should subscribe

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.750
to this YouTube channel.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.440
And if you want to see the most
recent Supercharged livestream,
