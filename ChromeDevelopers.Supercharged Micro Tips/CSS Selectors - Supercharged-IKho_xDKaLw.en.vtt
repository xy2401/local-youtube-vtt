00:00:02.912 --> 00:00:05.940
SURMA: CSS selectors are
mostly used for two things--

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.070
styling elements and
grabbing references

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.050
to elements using JavaScript.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.690
The syntax for CSS
selectors is powerful, maybe

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.040
more powerful than you know.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.660
And using them to
the fullest extent

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.280
can simplify your
markup and your code.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.030
For example, when you have a
number of fields in a form,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.790
it is natural to have a
name attribute on them.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.960
Often, I see
developers add classes

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.470
so they can reference
each field individually.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.040
This can be simplified using one
of CSS lesser-known selectors--

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.490
the attribute selector.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.580
The CSS attribute
selector is used

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.520
by putting the desired attribute
name and value in brackets

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.200
right after the element.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.660
By doing that, the selector
only matches elements

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.380
with a key value pair.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.740
So in our example, we can
use the name attribute

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.320
instead of having to put
distinct classes on our form

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.040
fields.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.760
And it doesn't end there.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.180
The attribute selector
is also capable of doing

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.400
partial matches with
an attribute value.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.660
You can use these others
syntaxes to make or select

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.950
your match if the attribute
value contains, starts, or ends

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.330
with a given string.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.950
This can be really
handy to select

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.190
entire groups of elements
using querySelectorAll.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.330
Quite useful, right?

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.950
Well, I thought so.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.860
If only there was
more Micro Tips.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.750
But wait, there are
more Micro Tips.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.310
And you should
watch all of them,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.410
