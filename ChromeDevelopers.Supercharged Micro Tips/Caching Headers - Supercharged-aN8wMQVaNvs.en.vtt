[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.194 --> 00:00:04.610
SURMA: One of the
common issues we

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.440
see when looking
at people's sites

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.940
is that they don't
cache resources

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.500
as well as they could.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.570
For example, they
set resources are

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.570
unlikely to change to
expire after a few minutes,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.650
and sometimes irregularly
changing files

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.830
are set to cache
for several weeks.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.930
And then you get into
cache-busting and fighting

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.580
with the browser's cache.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.380
What you probably
want to do instead

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.410
is to categorize your
resources in one of two ways--

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.200
things that need to be validated
with a server and things

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.800
that don't and can come
straight from the HTTP cache.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.500
Something that does normally
need to be revalidated

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.710
is HTML, since that's the
primary resource and the source

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.410
of truth for your app.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.780
Here you want a cache note
like this-- private, no-cache.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.030
That tells the browser that
the resource is intended

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.910
for just that user and that it
should check with the server

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.200
before serving it.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.150
Things that don't
need to be validated

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.840
would be things like
JavaScript, CSS, or images.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.270
Here, you'll want to tell the
browser that it should cache

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.440
the resource for like a year.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.319
But what do you do if you
need to change that resource?

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.770
You include a hash or
a [? version ?] name

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.271
in the resources path.

00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:09.770
There are plenty
of build tools that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.940
can help you achieve just that.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.900
Bear in mind that you shouldn't
be caching your HTML, which

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.960
means that when you change
the far future cache resource,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.230
you can update the reference to
it in the HTML and everything

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.849
should just work out.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.890
If you want to see what
your caching headers are,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.890
head to Dev Tools, Network
Panel, click on a resource,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.600
and choose the Headers tab.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.740
Laters.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.020
For more on this topic, you
can watch the Supercharged

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.010
livestream I did on server-side
rendering over there,

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.240
or read Jake's blog post, which
we link to in the description.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.190
But more importantly--
you actually know.
