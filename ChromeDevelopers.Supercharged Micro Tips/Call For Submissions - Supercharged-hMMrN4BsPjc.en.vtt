[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.260
Hello, internet.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.780
It's me, Paul.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.627
I want to talk to you
about Supercharged, mainly,

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:18.210
that I'm getting towards the end
of the list of the sites that

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.200
have been submitted.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.540
And so I need more.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.980
Because if there
aren't any more,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.580
then I'll just be staring
at you for five, six

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.280
minutes at a time, like this.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.381
And I don't know who's going to
feel more awkward about that.

00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:37.380
I'll be honest with you.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.470
It's probably going to be you.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.350
So if we want to avoid that,
and I suggest that we do,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.670
click on the link below,
tap in your details,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.080
and send me some sites
to have a look at.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.130
Maybe as a Christmas
present to me.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.910
And I will see you
once you've done that.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.570
Don't, don't, don't stop this
video until you click it.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.230
Click.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.030
Click it.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.280
See you next time.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.221
What do we want?

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:00.720
Websites!

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.595
When do we want them?

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:02.540
Now!

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.790
You know, you get the idea.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.290
Right?

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.840
OK.
