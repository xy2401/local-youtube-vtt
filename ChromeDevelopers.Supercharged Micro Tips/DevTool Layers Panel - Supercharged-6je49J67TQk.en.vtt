00:00:03.062 --> 00:00:05.520
SURMA: From time to time, we
have built some fairly complex

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.740
animations on "Supercharged"--
some might even

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.780
say unnecessarily complex.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.790
So for example, do you
remember this flipswitch

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.710
we built at the
Polymer Summit 2016?

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.450
It looks pretty neat, right?

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.022
But what is actually happening?

00:00:17.022 --> 00:00:19.230
Whenever you find one of
these animations on the web,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.150
it can be interesting to see
how the animation was done,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.880
but sometimes the
code is obfuscated,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.250
and it is not really obvious to
see what is actually happening

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.920
and what is just slight of hand.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.240
Enter DevTools.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.910
If you open DevTools, you
can open the context menu

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.132
on the right and take a
look at the more tools menu.

00:00:36.132 --> 00:00:37.590
There's a couple
of things in there

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.020
that you might not
know DevTools had.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.420
One of them is the layers panel.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.540
Set the animation speed to
10% and adjust the perspective

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.030
on the layers panel, so you
can see the individual layers

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.140
from the side.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.990
If you now play the animation,
it becomes crystal clear

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.840
what animation is happening
and in what order.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.066
Pretty useful, right?

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:56.940
So there you have it.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.130
Some of the less discoverable
features in DevTools

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.080
can prove quite useful.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.972
Thanks for watching,
and see you next time.

00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:05.804
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.990
One more?

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.280
[INAUDIBLE] one more?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.790
OK, so the deal is I need
you to subscribe or watch

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.380
the latest "Supercharged" video,
or they won't let me go home.
