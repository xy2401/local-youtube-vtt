[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.300
SURMA: If you've ever
worked with promises,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.270
you know that they can get a
bit annoying in the DevTools

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.020
console.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.280
Let's take fetch as an example.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.100
If I want it to work
with a response,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.830
I would call fetch, store
the promise to a variable,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.100
then call then, and
attach the result to self.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.920
Now I have my response object
available in the console

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.120
for inspection.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.250
That's a bit tedious.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.190
Therefore, DevTools now
supports top-level [? await ?]

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.010
without you having to declare
an asynchronous function.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.440
That means instead of the
triple jump that I just did,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.570
I can just use [? await ?]
to directly store

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.520
the response in a variable.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.330
Any API that uses promises
can be used this way

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.830
and will make your
life so much easier.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.480
It's good stuff, eh?

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.420
See you next time.
