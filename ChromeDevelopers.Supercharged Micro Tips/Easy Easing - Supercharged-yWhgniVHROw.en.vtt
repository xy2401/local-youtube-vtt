00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.680
Here's an old
school tip for you.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.930
If you can animate something
based on user input,

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.138
you probably don't want to
have it update immediately

00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:10.900
to track the input event because
it can often feel very jittery.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.740
Instead, what you should do is
use the oldest easing equation

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.580
in the book, which
looks like this.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.554
Value plus equals target minus
value, all over strength.

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:20.720
Here, we're changing the
value based on how close it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.874
is to the target.

00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:23.290
The closer it is,
the less it gets

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.184
moved, making it look way nicer.

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:26.600
So there you have
it, a little tip

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.150
to make your
input-based animations

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.170
a teeny bit smoother.
