00:00:01.776 --> 00:00:04.670
Let me show you FLIP, a way
to convert from animating

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.140
using expensive properties
like top, left, width,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.590
or height, which trigger
Layout and Paint, to cheaper

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.989
compositor-only operations,
like transform and opacity.

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.030
It's super useful when
you have an animation that

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.696
needs to adapt to
responsive breakpoints

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:19.460
and which you can't
hard code ahead of time.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.350
Firstly, we take a
snapshot of our element

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.000
at the start or first
position using something

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.890
like getBoundingClientRect.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.620
Then we make any
style changes we need,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.300
which will set our element to
its final or last position.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.100
Now our element is
in the last position,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.220
but we can make it
look like it's still

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.860
in its first
position by applying

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.047
a transform that inverts the
change that we just made.

00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:42.380
Finally, we can make the
element have its own compositor

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.004
layer with will-change
transform, which

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:46.050
means that the compositor
and GPU can help us out

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.841
with the animation.

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:48.980
And then we switch on
transitions on transforms

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.510
and remove that invert
transform that we applied.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.246
This plays the animation
from first to last.

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:55.120
So there you have it.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.320
We just swapped animating
expensive properties

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.422
for cheaper ones.

00:00:58.422 --> 00:00:59.880

as well as the FLIP.js
helper on GitHub.
