SPEAKER 1: A lot of websites use
web fonts, many fonts actually,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.630
to improve their
visual appearance.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.490
When many fonts are in
use, they can easily

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.500
add up to a couple
of hundred kilobytes.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.660
Yet, the control over
font loading with CSS

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.730
can feel a bit rigid.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.100
With a font loading API,
you can take control

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.540
over when and how
fonts should be loaded.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.230
Instead of loading our font
with a declaration in CSS,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.360
we can now load it
programmatically.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.540
You can create instances of the
font face type for each font

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.770
that you want to use.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.960
You provide a name and
a resource description

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.670
as it is common in CSS.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.130
Only when you call load,
however, will the browser

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.310
actually go ahead and fetch
the font file and parse it.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.230
The [INAUDIBLE]
returned by load will

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.560
be resolved when the loading
and parsing of the font is done.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.930
It is imported into
the system as a font,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.510
but not yet associated
with your document.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.170
To do that, you need to
call ADD on document.fonts.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.760
From here on in,
your font will be

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.829
available under the name you
provided to the constructor.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.620
These are the most
basic and important bits

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.360
of the font loading API.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.920
It seems fairly
primitive, but they

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.140
can be composed to
develop complex loading

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.030
strategies to make your
experience much better.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.540
Yay, fonts.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.290
See you next time.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.810
So you know these two buttons
to subscribe to the channel

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.490
and to watch our latest video.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.810
We did some market research.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.870
And it turns out the longer
you leave them on screen,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.790
the more people click it.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.980
And that means happy summer.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.530
You should click them.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.120
Clickity, click, click, click.
