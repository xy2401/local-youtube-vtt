SURMA: A very common thing
we see on websites is FUT--

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.010
a Flash of Unstyled Text.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.710
When using web fonts, the
text will be invisible

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.520
until either the
web font's loaded

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.850
or three seconds have
passed, at which point

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.560
the fallback font is used.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.660
To give developers
more choice over how

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.210
to deal with the
loading font, CSS now

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.490
has the font display property.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.520
The property defines three
time spans-- the block period,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.640
the swap period, and
the failer period.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.290
During the block
period, the text

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.470
will be made invisible if the
web font hasn't loaded yet,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.350
rendering it as blocked
on the web font.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.390
During the swap period,
the fallback font

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.660
will be used to render text, but
if the web font is successfully

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.820
loaded during the
swap period, the font

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.390
can be swapped from fallback
to the actual web font.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.330
If the failure period is
reached, loading the web font

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.720
is considered to have failed and
the fallback font will be used.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.910
Font display offers
modes that allocate

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.460
different amounts of time
to the different periods.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.680
I recommend font
display optional.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.530
This means either web font
is available within 100

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.020
milliseconds, which it can
achieve with a service worker,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.270
or it is not used at all.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.120
Font display is very new and
not consistently supported,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.620
but it is a progressive
enhancement.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.230
The directive is ignored
unless the browser

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.260
understands it and will make
your user experience much,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.460
much better.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.020
Got it?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.690
Great.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.190
See you next time.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.170
Surprise!

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm back.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.044
You just saw me talk
about font display.

00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:29.710
And now, I want to
ask you to subscribe,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.560
because you probably want
to see more of these videos.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.570
And if you're interested
in our live streams,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.626
the most recent
one is over there.
