00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:13.640
SPEAKER: Have you heard
the term "hoisting" before?

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.960
JavaScript does it, and
it's a fun word to say--

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.700
hoisting.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.840
But what actually is it?

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.760
So let's try and
clear things up.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.700
When you declare a function in
JavaScript, they are hoisted.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.770
This means that the
function name and the body

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.660
are added to the
current function scope

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.550
before execution begins.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.000
Basically, the first function a
can call the second function b

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.300
even though the second function
comes after the first function.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.030
Actually, you can even invoke
the function a right above

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.910
where it is declared
because of hoisting.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.410
Now the important
thing to note is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.720
that the variable declarations
with const and let

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.300
are not hoisted and
scoped to the block.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.280
So while storing a
function in the variable

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.130
is often seen as semantically
equivalent to using a named

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.930
function, it is not.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.465
In this example, the code
would fail because the const

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:58.310
and let are not hoisted.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.460
And without hoisting, the
order of declaration matters.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.590
Admittedly, hoisting
can be a bit confusing.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.239
But now you know how
it works, and you

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.860
can make an informed
decision when

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.260
to use these two ways
of declaring a function.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.950
Got it?

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.580
Good.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.226
See you next time.

Do I expect you to talk?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.410
No, Mr. Bond, I expect you
to develop and subscribe.
