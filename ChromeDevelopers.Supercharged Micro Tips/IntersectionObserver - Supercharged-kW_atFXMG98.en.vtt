SURMA: Knowing what is
and what is not invisible

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.500
can be very useful
information because lazy load

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.090
images, once they
come into view,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.730
you could stop playing a
video once it goes out of view

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.950
or you could save to
your analytics how

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.370
much of your blog post was
actually read by the user.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.860
IntersectionObserver,
our performance API,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.770
will notify you when an element
enters or leaves the viewport.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.930
IntersectionObservers are very
efficient, work across IFrames,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.690
and are perfect to
react to scrolling.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.830
To use
IntersectionObserver, create

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.980
a new IntersectionObserver by
passing it a callback function.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.990
For each element that
you're interested in,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.630
call that observe on the
IntersectionObserver.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.630
From now on, whenever any
of the observed elements

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.940
enter the viewport,
your callback

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.370
will be called with
details about what happened

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.400
and to which element.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.240
IntersectionObserver
offer a couple

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.300
of options, one of them
being the Thresholds option.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.160
You can set the threshold
option to an array

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.400
of numbers between 0 and 1
to get multiple notifications

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.960
per element.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.660
For example, if you set the
threshold option to 0.33, 0.66,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.300
and 1, you'll get notification
not only on entrance and exit

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.210
but also when 1/3 or 2/3 of
the elements area are in view.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.090
For more information on
the use cases and options,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.400
read my article in
the description below.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.230
Bye.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.350
I am a true artist, and my work
just convinced you of that.
