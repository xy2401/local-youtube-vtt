[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.830
Hello, and welcome
to "Supercharged."

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.330
I am Paul.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.580
This is the show where I
take the websites that you've

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.210
submitted, and I
go through them,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.720
and I look for
performance issues,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.520
and I try and figure
out what they are

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.230
and how we can do a better job.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.660
So today I have Jai's Weblog.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.850
He's a UI engineer at
FlipKart and an ex-Yahooian.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.100
And when I saw this
site, I thought, hmmm,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.800
there's an interesting
thing here.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.160
Not the page load,
which we normally do,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.400
but actually this side
menu caught my attention,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.110
because I thought,
that jenks a little bit

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.740
when it comes out on a desktop.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.580
And I wonder if it's just doing
something a little bit funny.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.144
And what it would look
like on a mobile device.

00:01:00.144 --> 00:01:01.810
So what we're going
to do is we're going

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.990
to hit Chrome inspect, like so.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.460
I have my Nexus device, my
Nexus 5 here, plugged in.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.000
And what I can do is I
can go and grab this URL,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and I could pop it
in here and say Open,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.087
and it opens a new tab on here,
which is magical and wonderful.

00:01:22.087 --> 00:01:23.170
And it's going to load up.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.120
And I can do Inspect, and it
brings up Chrome's dev tools

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.760
as we know and love.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.170
So good.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.820
And that means
that I can inspect

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.340
what's going on on the phone
in just the same way as I would

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.430
on desktop, except
that I also get

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.370
this additional
feature, which actually

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.860
shows me what's on the device.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.800
So if I click on this, it
actually happens on the phone,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.700
or I can click on here and
it happens on the screen.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.280
It's magical.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.870
I love that.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.270
Even looking at
what's on the phone,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.936
I can tell you that
this animation isn't

00:01:52.936 --> 00:01:54.440
running at 60 frames a second.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.960
Let's give ourselves a baseline.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.710
We're in the timeline.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.040
So what we'll do is we'll hit
the Record button like so.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.700
And I will hit that button
over there on the phone.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.340
And you see, yeah, goodness.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.930
OK.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.170
So it's just about 60
frames a second sometimes

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.390
and towards the end there,
it's shooting off the top.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.420
This rasterize is, what's that?

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.670
72 milliseconds.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.750
I'm holding Shift
here as I click, drag,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.150
and that gives me a time range.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.860
So 72 milliseconds.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.015
For an animation like
this, we want to be 16.

00:02:27.015 --> 00:02:27.640
So what's that?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.470
That's like four or five times.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.820
So, I don't know, 10,
12 frames a second.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.450
Roughly.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.300
Let's figure out why we're doing
an animation that's so slow.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.330
Right.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.854
The way to do this, let's
switch off the device bit.

00:02:42.854 --> 00:02:44.020
Actually, let's leave it on.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.722
Why not?

00:02:44.722 --> 00:02:45.680
We're all friends here.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.690
OK.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.120
So, straight away,
actually, on the body

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.100
there is a class
of nav open which

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.270
feels like it's something that's
relevant to our interests.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.190
Yes.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.870
OK.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.890
Margin left.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.690
Now I know from other work that
if you do something like margin

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.110
left, there we go, margin left.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.709
Changing margin left is
going to trigger layout,

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.250
it's going to trigger
paint, and it's

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.690
going to trigger composite.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.700
All three tasks are
quite expensive for us

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.220
to do during an animation.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.450
What we want to do
is if we're animating

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.430
we want to just a two
composite operations.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.020
So we can do that by
using, say, a transform.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.020
And in this case, a
transform in the whole body

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.320
would actually work really well
rather than using margin left.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.600
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go back, check out

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.012
csstriggers.com.

00:03:36.012 --> 00:03:38.840
I mean, I built it, so
I'm going to promote it.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.270
But it's still
pretty cool anyway.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.019
Let's have a look.

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.117
We have dev tools open still.

00:03:44.117 --> 00:03:45.950
So rather than margin
left, what did we say?

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.000
We're going to do a transform.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.270
And let's translate
X, 15.75 VMs,

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.050
we have a transition,
which we're

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.250
going to change from
margin to transform.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.410
Transform.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.500
There we go.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.827
There is a Webkit version
here, [INAUDIBLE],

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:06.410
so you could do the
[INAUDIBLE] prefix

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.230
version as well
if you were doing

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.540
something similar to this.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.460
And let's see now, if we switch
on show paint rectangles.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.790
So with that in
place, does that work?

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.290
Oh.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.123
It's still painting.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.220
What we need to
do, what we should

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.810
do is since we're
doing a transform,

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.320
we should tell
Chrome in this case

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.070
that we will be
changing the transform

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.169
of the elements in question.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.710
So there's a green
flash there, which

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.370
tells us that it's just promoted
something to its own layer,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.530
I guess.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.720
So now if we actually leave
the show paint rectangles on,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.690
yeah, there's a green
flash where the button was.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.730
Which makes sense because it's
probably got a selected state.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.820
And now, let's go back to
timeline to record again.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.980
There we go.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.180
We've gone from 10, 12 frames
a second in some places to 60.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.036
There's a little
bit of a jump there,

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:09.410
which may or may
not be something

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.465
depending on how
we did, but you can

00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:13.290
see that we've hit
60 frames a second.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.470
We're in a really good spot.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.351
Instead of animating margin
left, or any of the properties

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:20.850
that would trigger
layout and paint,

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.180
you just want to stick to things
like transform and opacity

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.390
where we can for animations.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.380
And certainly in this
case we definitely can.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.840
And by doing that, we've gone
from 30 frames a second-ish all

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.100
the way up to 60.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.760
So take a look at
your animations.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.900
See if there's
opportunities to switch out

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.470
those kind of expensive
operations for the easier,

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.300
cheaper ones, and hopefully
you'll get a good performance

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.700
base there, too.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.730
Don't forget to subscribe
and I'll catch you next time.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.550
Some mornings I get
out of bed and I'm just

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.395
Paul, some days I am Paul,
master of the performance, king

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:56.529
of the timeline.
