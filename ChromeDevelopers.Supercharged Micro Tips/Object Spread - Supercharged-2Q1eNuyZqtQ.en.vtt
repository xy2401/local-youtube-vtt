[KEYBOARD TYPING]

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:13.690
SURMA: Have you heard of
the array spread operator?

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.149
It allows you to concatenate
multiple arrays into one.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.800
It's quite handy, really.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.170
Now the same operator
also works with objects

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.600
and is therefore called
the Object Spread operator.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.684
Who would have thought it?

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:25.641
If you want to merge
multiple objects into one,

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:27.070
you can just use
the curly braces

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.830
and list all the objects
that you want to merge.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.140
This can come in especially
handy for options

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.850
and the default values.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.340
Imagine writing a function
that takes an options object,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.320
like it is common in JavaScript.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.910
You could define
these default values

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.370
for all these options
in a private variable.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.620
When the function is called,
merge the default options

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.390
with the user provided options.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.980
The result will be
an options object

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.890
where you can be sure that all
options are set to a default

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.340
value, except where the user
has provided another value.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.510
Handy, isn't it?

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.245
So enjoy, and see you next time.

00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:00.036
Did you know that I
have a new series where

00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:02.255
I build a PWA using WordPress?

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:04.379
If not, you can go there
right now and take a look.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.880
It's quite good, really.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.300
But also, you can
subscribe to get CommitLog,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.790
to get Supercharged
light strings,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.720
to get Supercharged microchips,
all off Supercharged

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.380
