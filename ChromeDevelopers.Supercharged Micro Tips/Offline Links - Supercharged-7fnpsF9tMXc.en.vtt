SURMA: Making your
app work offline

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.080
is one of the cornerstones of
a good progressive web app.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.720
But not everything can
be made to work offline.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.960
And letting your users know
what they can and cannot do is

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.450
important for a smooth
user experience.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.510
As a simple example, while
the landing page of your blog

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.640
will surely be
available offline,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.700
you probably won't have
all your posts cached.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.130
Some blog posts on the
landing page can be clicked,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.820
while others cannot.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.940
To convey this to the
user, a simple trick

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.980
is to fade out the
links of articles

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.780
that are not available.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.400
When the offline
event is omitted,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.350
you can traverse all your links,
check if they're in the cache

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.830
by using the cache
API, and set a style

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.670
that fades the text out.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.120
Additionally, set
pointer events to none,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.190
so that they become unclickable.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.140
When the online
event is omitted,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.970
remove the stars
again, and everything

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.740
will be back to normal.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.440
And that's it-- a simple trick
with a couple lines of code

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.920
to make your UI respond to
changes in connectivity.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.560
Keep in mind, though, that an
online event doesn't actually

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.450
mean the user has connectivity.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.940
For example, they could
be behind a captive portal

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.880
at an airport.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.910
So Li-Fi is a thing.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.410
See you next time.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.840
If you like Supercharged,
you should probably

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.340
subscribe to this
channel, so you

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.350
know about all the new videos.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.910
Or if you don't
want to wait, you

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.490
can watch our most recent
live stream over there.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.110
And actually, you
should do both.
