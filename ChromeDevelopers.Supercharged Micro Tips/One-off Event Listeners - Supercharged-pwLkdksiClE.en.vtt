[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.070
SURMA: We all have used event
listeners, and many of you

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.870
have probably
encountered a scenario

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.550
where you are
waiting for an event

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.590
before you can continue to work.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.470
In that scenario, you are no
longer interested in that event

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.630
after the first one has arrived.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.450
Traditionally, you would
create a name to local function

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.490
so you can call
addEventListener, and then

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.150
also call removeEventListener
once the first event has fired.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.360
This way, your callback
will only be executed once.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.580
But because this is
such a common pattern,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.940
the addEventListener function
now has a once option.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.030
Set the once option to true, and
your event listener will only

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.060
be executed, well, once.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.810
You don't need to worry
about the cleanup,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.220
because that is done for you.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.410
Neat.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.900
Short and to the point.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.840
That's a Micro Tip.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.710
And there's more
where that came from.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.160

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.090
