[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:21.460
Hello, and welcome
to "Supercharged."

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.330
I'm Paul.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.620
Oh!

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.120
Aah!

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.940
That's why we don't
do it live action.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.680
The show where I take the
sites that you've submitted,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.530
and I go through them.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.810
And I look for
performance issues,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.934
and I recommend some fixes.

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:33.120
That's the show.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.660
Welcome!

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.400
Today I have Player FM.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.560
And Player FM is an
interesting one for me

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.810
because it's run by
Mike [? Marmov ?] who

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.100
is a small business
owner, and so he's

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.390
dealing with the sites and
the app that he's built

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.470
and lots of other
things besides.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.220
And so for him I suspect that
performance is important,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.900
but it's not necessarily
what's on his mind day to day.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.920
He's just trying to run his
business and do well there.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.046
So it was an opportunity
to look at something where

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:01.128
the constraints are little
bit different, at least

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:02.370
from the business side.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.430
Serious performance work
about to take place.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.170
Hmm, yes, one has goggles.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.890
Not strictly necessary, but
they do make you look fabulous.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.260
I have the home page
up on screen here.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.390
And what I wanted
to do was just do

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.740
a WebPagetest first and
foremost, and have a quick look

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.511
and just see if there's anything
quick and easy to fix in there.

00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:24.010
And I've gone to the filmstrip
view which you can get if you

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.880
chick-- check, chick, check--

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.080
[CLUCKING]

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.230
If you check the box
that says, capture video,

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.222
it'll capture a video.

00:01:33.222 --> 00:01:35.180
And that will give you
the filmstrip view which

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.430
is what we're looking at here.

00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:43.300
The thing I notice,
first of all,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.780
is that when you look at where
the first paint happens--

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.270
which is here.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.510
It's actually that green
line there on the waterfall,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.700
I believe.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.830
You can see there's actually
blocking on a few things.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.910
There's the fonts.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.330
There's the page CSS which
is quite big as well.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.130
It's like 100K or so.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.005
So you'd really feel this on 3G.

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:06.380
Now I'm not doing
it on 3G today.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.331
Because I figure for most
people, if they're on mobile,

00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:11.080
they've probably got
the app, for example.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.210
So I opted to go with a
desktop audience here.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.630
So we have-- the page comes in.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.880
Then there's the CSS.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.140
There is an image.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.110
There's the JavaScript.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.370
There's the fonts which
then need to be transferred.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.970
There seems to be
some-- what's this?

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.420
There's a Google
JavaScript client there,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.810
and then there's the web fonts.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.670
And then eventually
it goes right-- now

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.934
I've got enough to render.

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:37.350
So I think the
first thing I'd say

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.700
is, it's a critical
rendering path.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.100
Our job here is to
[? interline ?] some styles.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.111
Let's have a look-- see if there
are any in the page source.

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:48.470
[GULP]

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.080
Gaaah.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.790
So I suspect there aren't any.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.290
Because they'd be
here if they were.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.540
And I think that's
probably one of the options

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.810
that we have here is
to try and reprioritize

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.970
the page load to try and get
critical rendering path done.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.780
But even with that
in play, there's

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.340
something quite interesting
about this home page,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.830
which is the
scrolling performance.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.400
Let me bring up DevTools.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.250
And this has recently
changed, its seems.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.850
And you can find the old
school rendering tools

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.680
under more tools and
then rendering settings.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.232
And then you can go to
enable paint flashing.

00:03:27.232 --> 00:03:28.590
Flash.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.644
As you scroll, you'll see that
the whole page goes green.

00:03:33.644 --> 00:03:35.810
And that basically means
the whole page is painting.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.310
And also it's painting-- you
see it's pretty slow to paint.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.470
So let's have a look at why.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.080
We're in the timeline.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.280
We can hit record, and
we'll do a scroll test

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.340
in the background.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.150
Stop scrolling.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.140
And you see these red
triangles here in the corner

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.410
is basically where Chrome
is telling you that it's not

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.020
able to hit 60 frames a second.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.670
And it's a little bit
forgiving around the 60 frames

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.520
a second mark.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.860
I can't remember
the exact numbers.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.651
But we are at eight frames
a second, 10, seven.

00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:08.900
So for something that should
be scrolling at 60 frames

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.050
a second, we're
really struggling.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.350
And what we can do is we
can have a look at why.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.696
And you see these tile
workers-- which are basically

00:04:15.696 --> 00:04:18.070
the parts of Chrome that are
doing the painting-- they're

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.630
all very, very clogged up.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.697
So we can have a look in.

00:04:20.697 --> 00:04:22.530
We can hit the w key
on the keyboard-- which

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.857
is like the zoom in-- and
it says, rasterize paint.

00:04:25.857 --> 00:04:27.940
And that correlates very
closely with what we saw,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.390
that sort of green paint
that we saw earlier.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.740
So let me see if we
can figure out why.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.260
And I'm betting it's the
parallax thing that's

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.390
going on, would be my
guess because I've seen

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.520
sites that do similar things.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.220
So we'll just
inspect that element.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.310
See if we can bring that up.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.890
Section.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.580
Yes.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.940
We have background
position-- 50.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.080
Blah blah blah.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.840
So these all look
like-- yeah they're

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.173
being changed by the JavaScript.

00:04:57.173 --> 00:04:59.720
You can see that you can watch
the numbers change up here.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.830
And the problem we have is that
this is causing it to paint.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.740
What we'll do is, we'll
stop it doing this.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.850
And then I will show
you how you can actually

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.980
have a proper look at this
in more detail yourself.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.438
So what I'll do
is-- I'm just going

00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:14.512
to set background
position to be-- I'm

00:05:14.512 --> 00:05:15.970
just going to do--
what has he got?

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.190
Like roughly 50%, zero.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.830
And I'm going to
put important on it

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.880
just so that it never changes.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.340
And those images
are fixed right now.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.700
So when they're fixed-- when we
scroll, what's going to happen

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.200
is-- Chrome's going to go, well
that's got to be there still

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.033
on the page, so it
paints it again and again

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:34.210
and again and again.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.472
So what we can do is we
can find, presumably, a [?

00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:38.962
background attachment:
fixed. ?] Yes here it is.

00:05:38.962 --> 00:05:40.920
I'm just going to toggle
that off for a second.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.670
So that they scroll
with the page content.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.310
Now even though these
styles are being

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.212
updated by the page
in the JavaScript,

00:05:49.212 --> 00:05:51.170
they're not going to
change the actual position

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.280
because we changed it to
important and don't move.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.300
So with that all in place,
let's now go back over here

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.210
and we're going to hit record,
and we're going to scroll.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.230
And we are, pretty much,
back to 60 frames a second.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.790
There are few things like
these image decodes and so on.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.310
But the main gist of it
is that by just not doing

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.430
that background
position scroll thing,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.725
we're in a lot better state.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:19.656
Yes!

00:06:19.656 --> 00:06:21.780
So awhile ago, I wrote this
post about parallaxing.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.430
And in here is the
option two, which

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.330
is what I'd suggest--
it would be worth

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.750
doing here for Player FM.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.390
It's using DOM elements rather
than background position.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.171
Put those images onto
their own element,

00:06:34.171 --> 00:06:36.420
and then use a 3D transform--
or even a 2D transform--

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.810
with something like, will
change our [? translateZ(0 ?].

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.620
That's right, I'll
hack if necessary.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.150
We're quite pragmatic
around these parts.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.940
And you can here
see what it's like

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.366
if you just use that approach.

00:06:49.366 --> 00:06:51.800
And what I'll do is, I'll
do a timeline recording

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.090
just so that you see it.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.670
And scroll up and down.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.970
And it's pretty much 60
frames a second everywhere.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.180
And the reason it's 60 frames
a second is because we're using

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.830
transforms.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.960
And transforms we can do--
if it's on its own layer,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.220
it can be done by the GPU,
and that's extremely fast.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.662
So you can do 60 frames a
second parallax effects.

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:11.120
I think right now
the way that it's

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.760
being done on this
page where it uses

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.640
background position, that's not
going to be 60 frames a second.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.610
But when you can do it with
a transform and have it

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.460
operate on individual
elements, that you can do.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.261
I can't juggle.

00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:25.760
I can't.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.011
I don't even know why I tried.

00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:27.676
All right, cool.

00:07:27.676 --> 00:07:28.879
So that's the homepage done.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:30.920
So what we'll do is we'll
actually switch across,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.330
and we'll look at
a details page--

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.510
as in for one of the series.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.870
And it just so happens
I have exactly the right

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.940
URL up my sleeve,
which involves two idiots--

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.910
me and Wakey Jakey Vegas,
doing a nice

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:47.920
HTTP 203 podcast.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.670
It's a subtle plug.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.231
If you just pay the
slightest attention,

00:07:52.231 --> 00:07:54.230
it's almost like I'm
saying, subscribe subscribe

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.221
This time we don't have
any, I don't think,

00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:00.930
any scroll performance
issues particularly.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.040
Basically because the
page is fairly static.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.530
However, I think
what we can do is,

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.390
we can have ourselves another
sneaky peek at WebPagetest.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.650
So let's pop that in there.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.040
Do that.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.030
We'll do it on Chrome cable.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.530
Seems good.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:19.310
Capture a video so that you can
do the video filmstrip thing.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.255
Oh yes, we're waiting.

00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:24.806
What's he going to do next?

00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:25.820
Yes, that's right.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.706
He's going to
jettison his career.

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:28.580
Here are the results.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.990
We've switched up to a one tenth
of a second for the intervals.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.980
And yet, similar kind of story--
I think-- to the homepage.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.809
Except this time, we
look-- to my eye--

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:45.900
like we're blocking on
the, obviously, the page.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.340
But then there's
some JavaScript,

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.520
and then there's
some CSS-- bunch

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.674
of image assets, which is fine.

00:08:52.674 --> 00:08:53.590
It's kind of expected.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.089
But then there's
web fonts, and then

00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:57.920
only after the web
fonts have arrived,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.472
do we actually do
the initial paint.

00:09:01.472 --> 00:09:03.180
And yeah, actually,
you can see if you're

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.620
to look into one
of these pages, you

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:12.860
get that blank, white
screen before the font

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.100
is actually available.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.575
So that can be quite
frustrating for users,

00:09:17.575 --> 00:09:19.950
depending on how long it takes
for the font to come down.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:25.220
One option is to have
the font essentially not

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.990
be there-- use a system font.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.830
And then try and get the
web font for the next time.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.550
So lazy load it and then
deal with it next time.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.640
That could be a bit of a
challenge to orchestrate,

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.890
which is hopefully where things
like font display will help.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.550
But for the time
being, it might just

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.230
be worth switching this font
back out to a system font--

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.750
if it is a web font,
and it looks like it is.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.800
Or just using the
web font for titles

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.125
and leaving the system font for
the majority of the content.

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:56.500
There's a few
things I would look

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:03.010
at on both the homepage and
the individual podcast pages.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.720
And, you know, that's great.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.850

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.036
That would be awesome.

00:10:12.036 --> 00:10:14.710
And I will catch you next time.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.335
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:15.335 --> 00:10:17.965
I haven't been allowed out
of this room in three weeks.

00:10:17.965 --> 00:10:20.298
Put makeup on you before you
go out on camera, you know.

00:10:20.298 --> 00:10:21.600
Ha ha.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.210
There, they said, Paul,
you've got a shiny head.
