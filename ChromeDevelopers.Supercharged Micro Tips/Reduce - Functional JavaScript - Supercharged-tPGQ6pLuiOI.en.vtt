00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.090
Reduce() is both a powerful,
and often misunderstood function

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.140
on arrays.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.720
In other functional languages,
it's often called fold,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.040
or compress, or accumulate,
but it's quite aptly named

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.040
in JavaScript, as it reduces an
entire array to a single value

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.870
determined by the reducer--

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.120
the function it
takes as an argument.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.770
The standard example
is calculating

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.000
the sum of an array of numbers.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.050
So let's take a closer look at
how reduce() and the reducer

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.070
interacts.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.010
Reduce() takes the first
two elements in the array,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.610
and uses the reducer function to
reduce them to a single value.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.090
Next, the process repeats with
the previously calculated value

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.190
and the next value in the array.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.290
And this process keeps
repeating until we

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.660
are left with a single value.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.330
Reduce() needs a bit of getting
used to in the way it works,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.210
but once you are there,
it is incredibly useful.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.670
It can be used to implement
set partitioning, finding

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.190
the maximum, array
flattening, and solve

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.220
many other common problems
in a very flexible way.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.761
We have one more episode
left in this miniseries,

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:17.260
and in the next one we're going
to talk about the rather new

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.550
flatMap().

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.410
So if you find that
interesting, you

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.140
should subscribe so you
can get a notification when

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.680
the new episode comes out.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.040
But until then, there are
some more "Supercharged"

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.100
for you to watch.
