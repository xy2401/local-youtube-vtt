PAUL LEWIS: Welcome to
this Supercharged TL;DW.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.470
I'm Paul, and last week
Surma and I built a router.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.720
Let me show you what we built.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.303
So you'll recognize
this kind of thing

00:00:19.303 --> 00:00:21.930
from progressive web apps, or
in just any web app really,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.412
where you've got a page,
and you can click on a nav,

00:00:25.412 --> 00:00:27.650
and it dynamically
switches the section,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.820
it updates the route
in the address bar.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.290
And you can click back and
forth, and so on as you go.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.790
Well, let's take a
look at the code.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.790
But, no wait, before
we do that, we

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.270
need to have ourselves a
chat over in Theory Corner.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.680
Oh, welcome to Theory
Corner, theory in a corner,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.290
one of my favorite
places to have theory.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.570
We have our router here.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.059
And the router actually
has to have two modes.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.350
And a lot of people, when
they make their first router,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.200
they don't realize that
you need both modes.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.160
You have an active mode, where
you tell the router, actively,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.269
I want to go to this URL.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.280
But also, you need
a passive mode.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.655
When the URL changes, the
router needs to be notified.

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:12.030
So this is its kind of passive
mode, where it's listening

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.200
for the popstate event.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.715
And in both cases,
we're going to handle

00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:16.840
what happens with the view.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.780
So the router kind of has to
be the middle of your world.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.530
Well, of course, when
you push actively,

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.370
you also need to
pushState as well,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.330
and change the URL yourself.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.750
OK, so we've got all
that set up on this side.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.250
As I say, what we
do is we look at

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.310
say the path name
of the location,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.810
and then we decide, well,
which view needs to come in,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.960
which view needs to go out.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.610
If it's the same view, then
we need to just update.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.220
And we decide all that
in here, in the router.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.020
Welcome back to reality.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.880
I love it over here.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.550
It's great.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.930
There's code in reality.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.900
Super duper, let's actually
have a look at some code.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.050
First of all, let's
have a look in the HTML.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.100
Now, the first
thing to notice is

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.370
that we have a couple
of custom elements.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.224
Now, you don't have to
use custom elements.

00:01:58.224 --> 00:02:00.140
We just took the opportunity
to give it a try.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.820
We got sc-view here,
which represents a view

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.140
that we want to move between.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.857
The thing to notice here is
there is a route attribute.

00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:09.440
The route attribute
we're going to use

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.830
to decide which view should be
shown, or hidden, or whatever.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.440
Further down, we also
have this sc-router,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.160
and then you'll see that there's
JavaScript to control both.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.400
Let's have a look in the
sc-router, then, itself.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.551
It, itself, extends
the HTML element,

00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:29.300
because it's going to
be a custom element.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.549
And you can see at the bottom,
we call registerElement

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.920
down here, and we
tell it what we want.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.670
Well, that's fine.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.570
And that means that we
get createdCallbacks,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.520
attachedCallbacks,
detachedCallbacks,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.685
all those kind of things.

00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:42.060
Really, really
useful, because it

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.250
allows us to have a lifecycle.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.000
The main thing to notice is
in the attachedCallback here,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.310
we call the addEventListener
on popstate,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.690
and we say that we've got
this onChanged function.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.080
And you will discover
this onChanged function

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.670
is where all the really
interesting stuff happens.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.930
Same with the detachedCallback,
we just remove it.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.690
When you create it, we actually
set up that onChanged callback,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.410
and we actually match
a bunch of routes

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.420
where we create a map for them.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.870
So what happens here
is in the addRoutes,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.770
you see we ask for all
the views, the sc-views,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.490
and we step through each one.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.910
And we add a route
for it, which involves

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.740
creating a regular expression
from the views route

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.870
and assigning it to the view,
so that later on we can say,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.545
you know, which
route do we have?

00:03:24.545 --> 00:03:28.040
Ah, that's the view that we need
to either bring in or take out.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.247
So that's actually
all the setup work.

00:03:30.247 --> 00:03:32.830
What we need to do is we need
to have a look quickly at the go

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.163
function, which I mentioned
over there in Theory Corner.

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:36.920
This is the active one.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.620
We've got
window.history.pushState,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.510
so we're going to
push the new URL.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.927
And again, we call
this onChanged.

00:03:41.927 --> 00:03:43.468
Well, I think we're
ready to actually

00:03:43.468 --> 00:03:46.260
have a look at the onChanged,
so let's head over there.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.160
So the onChanged itself,
the first thing we do

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.960
is we ask for the
current pathname,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.240
and then we step through
all the routes that we have,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.010
and we try and find a match.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.280
If we don't find one,
well, we just leave.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.180
Not to worry.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.790
If we do find one, that's
when things get a little bit

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.289
interesting, because there's
three things that could happen.

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:08.420
We either need to
just bring it in,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.920
if there's no existing view.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.506
If there is an
existing view, we need

00:04:11.506 --> 00:04:13.380
to decide whether we're
just updating a view,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.129
or whether we're telling
one to transition

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.079
out, so that we can
bring our new one in.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.434
So let's deal with
those one at a time.

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:21.850
Let's actually
deal with the state

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.516
where you've actually
got a currentView.

00:04:23.516 --> 00:04:25.200
So there's something
up on screen,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.400
and it's either a match for
the currentView, the new one.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.060
And if it is, we can just update
it with any new information

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.880
that we might have from the URL.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.850
If not, it's basically
a replacement

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.637
for the currentView.

00:04:37.637 --> 00:04:39.220
So we have to tell
that one to go out,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.540
the current one to go out.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.170
And we wait on a promise here,
and I'll talk about that more

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.510
in a moment.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.660
Whenever the
currentView has left,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.250
and that might happen
immediately if there isn't one,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.770
we can update our reference
to the currentView,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.010
and we can tell the
newView to animate in.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.660
Now, you might have
noticed that these in, out,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.810
and update functions--
oh, there we go,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.650
I can double click if I try hard
enough-- in, out, and update,

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.490
and you might be thinking,
well, where do those get set?

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.040
Well, remember back
here, we actually

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.470
had an sc-view element, and
we have an sc-view class, very

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.920
similar to the sc-router one.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.770
It stands for supercharged.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.530
Kapow, branding.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.940
All right, so we've got
sc-router and sc-view.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.700
In the sc-view, here's the
in, the out, and the update.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.660
And the main thing about
the in and the out,

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.420
particularly, is what
they do is they just

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.170
simply add a class to the view.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.270
And that view is going
to, then, animate in.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.570
It's going to do a scale
and an opacity change,

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.510
to kind of fade in
or out, depending

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.220
on, well, you know, whether
it's coming in or going.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.910
When that animation is finished,
we fire a transitionEnd,

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.860
and that means we can
resolve the promise.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.230
This is an easy way for us
to chain up these animations,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.080
so that the in can definitely
follow the out animation.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.480
But you could overlap them.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.700
You just decide when you
want to resolve the promise,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.694
and that will cause the
animation to trigger.

00:05:54.694 --> 00:05:55.360
So there you go.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.480
That's all that's involved
in making a router.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.720
It involves making a
passive and an active,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.920
and it also involves
chaining up a few promises.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.128
Of course, you could make
a much more advanced router

00:06:04.128 --> 00:06:06.770
by allowing people to
load in content lazily.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.270
And if you want us to make that
one in the next live stream,

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.535
just pop a comment in below.

00:06:10.535 --> 00:06:11.410
We're watching those.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.420
We're going to respond to them.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.300
And we really appreciate
your feedback.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.820
So don't forget to
subscribe to the channel.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.410
And Surma and I will
be back in a few weeks

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.451
with another live stream.

00:06:18.451 --> 00:06:20.750
And I'll catch you right there.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.870
There is the live stream.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.980
You should watch that if
you've got a spare hour.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.480
Brilliant.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.875
Oh, and there's also the
subscribe, or down there.

00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:27.750
Either one will work.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.727
They're both good.

00:06:28.727 --> 00:06:29.810
Click one of them, though.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.580
Good idea.
