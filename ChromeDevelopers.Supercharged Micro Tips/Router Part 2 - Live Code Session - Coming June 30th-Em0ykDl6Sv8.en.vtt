PAUL LEWIS: Hello.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.474
In the last Livestream,
Surma and I built a router.

00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:07.890
And we took it as far as we
could in the time that we had.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.100
And we said, do you want
us to take it even further?

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.930
And you said, yes.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.660
So that's exactly what
we're going to do.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.510
In the next Livestream, we're
going to take the router we

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.060
made last time-- so
watch that if you

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.550
haven't-- and we're going to
build on that and make it even

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.090
more awesomer-er-er and things.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.130
And it will probably
have bugs, because I'll

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.660
be doing the coding and stuff.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.400
See you there.
