00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.690
PAUL LEWIS: Hello, and welcome
to this Supercharged TL;DW,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.975
the sort of beard-free version.

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:17.600
I don't know what
happened to the hair.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.183
It just--
[SUCKING AND POPPING SOUND],

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:21.020
it abandoned me, like
the stuff up there.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.940
[GRUNTING]

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.499
Well, last time, Surma
and I took the router

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.290
that we made two sessions
ago and turned it

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.910
into a more advanced router.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.260
Let me show you what we did.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.810
So you can see on
screen, it's not

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.100
vastly different from last
time, except that now we've

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.010
got this spinner, and
then the content fades in.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.200
But actually, under the hood,
a bunch of things have changed.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.120
Let's talk about that over
there in Theory Corner.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.500
[LAUGHTER] Hello,
welcome to Theory Corner.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.590
Good of you to join me.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.880
That's probably
because I asked you to.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.838
Don't worry about that.

00:00:50.838 --> 00:00:53.710
Anyway, the router is
pretty much the same

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.160
as last time,
except last time, we

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.310
had one index page, which
had all the content in.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.870
And no matter which
URL you went to,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.740
we served you the same index.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.630
No more.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.730
What we've done is we've
broken each of these out

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.130
into their own individual pages.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.630
That means, when
we deep link, we're

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.410
just going to show
those individual pages.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.880
But we can enhance
with the JavaScript.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.750
So what happens if
you go to the About

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.440
page is that we leave
placeholder sections,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.147
if you like, for
Contact, Misc, and Home.

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:23.730
And then when you
choose one of those,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.660
we XHR or Fetch--
it's your choice;

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.590
I chose XHR for reasons
that will become

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.430
clear-- we XHR or Fetch them
in, and we populate them

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.320
dynamically.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.840
And while we're waiting,
we show a spinner.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.930
All make sense?

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.430
Good.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.440
Let's go look at some code.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.080
Welcome back to the codey bit.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.230
I love code.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.610
Who doesn't?

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.300
[LAUGHS]

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.600
Yes, now the code.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.750
Well, in fact, as I said
over in Theory Corner,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.960
not a lot actually
changed inside the router.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.000
In fact, most of our changes
have happened in the HTML

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.200
and in the View.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.080
So let's have a
look at the HTML.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.392
So this is what it looks
like in the main index.

00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:01.100
You can see, we've
still got our SC.View,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.340
which is the custom
element for the view.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.700
But we have now
added a visible class

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.820
for each individual
area that's visible.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.190
In this case, the
visible area is home.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.200
And we have these placeholders,
like we talked about in Theory

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.680
Corner for the other views.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.560
But you'll see, they've got this
additional attribute of remote

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.526
on them, which we're going
to pick up in the JavaScript.

00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:21.900
While we're also
here, it's worth

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.900
noticing that, if we notice
that the view is remote,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.540
we have a before and an after.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.640
The before is a
solid color block,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.260
which its color is
inherited from the parents.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.810
And the after is
this spinner graphic

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.801
that you saw right at the start.

00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:38.300
Well, how does it
all come together?

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.930
Well, for that, we need
to look at the view.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.040
So our view is pretty
much the same as it was.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.546
And you'll remember from
last time we have something

00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:47.670
that returns a new promise.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.434
And we just add
the visible class.

00:02:49.434 --> 00:02:51.100
And we could fade it
in, which was fine,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.450
because all the content
lived inside one page,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.280
but now we got to
load in remotely.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.770
So what we do is we
say, if this is remote--

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.780
which looks for that
attribute, the remote

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.920
attribute on the view-- and
we've not loaded it in before,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.340
load it in.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.670
So that then says, well,
what does the load in code

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.250
look like?

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.330
Great, glad you asked.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.640
Kapow.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.290
The code looks like this.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.820
We have, in our case, an XHR.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.340
Now, why not use Fetch?

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.170
That would be a fairly
obvious thing to do.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.380
The reason is, you can't
Fetch in a document.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.110
You can XHR in and say the
response type is document.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.800
But for Fetch, the
best you can do

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.560
is get text and then pass it to
a DOMParser, so new DOMParser

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.330
parses text, I think it is,
and you tell it it's HTML.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.770
Not quite as
convenient in my view.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.770
There's nothing wrong with
an XHR, so let's do that.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.310
And so what we do is
we create our XHR.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.060
We set the response
type to document.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.810
And then what we do
is we look at the URL

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.756
that we were trying to get to,
and we basically XHR that in.

00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:52.630
And whatever we get back
from the server side

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.680
is what we're
going to work with.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.060
So you'll notice inside there,
we query out the visible view.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.470
So for example, if we've
requested the About page,

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.572
then the Visible View
will be the About content.

00:04:03.572 --> 00:04:05.280
Then what we can do
is, you can see we've

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.614
got this dot underscore view.

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:09.280
And you might be
wondering, what's that?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.760
Well, just look a
little bit further up,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.420
you'll see it's a
document fragment.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.970
So it's a bit of detached
DOM that we can work with.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.480
So we create one of these
detached DOM fragments,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.250
basically.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.180
And we populate it
with whatever we

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.429
manage to pull out from the
view that we loaded in remotely.

00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:26.970
So we populate all
that, and then you

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.524
can see that we append
it to this view.

00:04:30.524 --> 00:04:32.440
After that, there's just
a bit of bookkeeping.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.430
You remember, I
mentioned there's

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.580
the before and the after
with the spinner on.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.990
Well, what we do is we
start, as soon as we call

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.730
into the loadView,
we basically say,

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.670
set a timeout for half a second.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.500
If we get to the
half a second, we're

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.980
going to show that spinner.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.324
If we don't get to half
a second, no big deal,

00:04:47.324 --> 00:04:48.490
we'll just show the content.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.220
But if we do, you'll
see here, we've

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.960
got the showSpinner, which
turns on the opacity.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.107
And then when the content
is actually loaded,

00:04:56.107 --> 00:04:57.190
we can clear that timeout.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.200
And we can also hide
the spinner, which

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.330
will cause it to fade out.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.000
And that will reveal
the content behind.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.684
So there you go.

00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:06.100
Doesn't look like
a massive amount

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.380
of difference for the user, but
it's a huge difference for us.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.400
And it's actually a very
positive difference,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.733
because it's allowed us to
have progressive enhancement.

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:15.920
We can now get to those URLs
without any JavaScript switched

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.420
on.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.130
And we can progressively enhance
into a more advanced router

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.120
from there.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.150
So there you go.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.817
Brilliant stuff.

00:05:21.817 --> 00:05:23.566
Don't forget to check
out the live stream.

00:05:23.566 --> 00:05:25.975
If you've not had chance,
it's about an hour long.

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:28.840
In fact, no, I think it was
slightly shorter this time.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.910
Time saving for the win!

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.260
