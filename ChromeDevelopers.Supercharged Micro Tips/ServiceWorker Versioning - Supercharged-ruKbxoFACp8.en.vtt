SURMA: When developing
a ServiceWorker,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.710
it is common to split up
the code into multiple files

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.590
and load them using the
Import Scripts function.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.560
The problem is that changes
in one of the imported files

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.180
might not reach
the ServiceWorker,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.120
as the file that does the
importing did not actually

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.170
change.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.930
An easy way around that is
to put your app's version

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.450
number into the main
ServiceWorker file

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.240
and update the version
number on every build.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.270
Let's look at a project that
uses scope as an example.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.360
In our build task, we bump the
patch version of our project.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.060
In the gulp file, we
read the package.json

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.980
and use it to
replace a placeholder

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.800
in the ServiceWorker file with
the current version number.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.680
This way, every build will
have a unique ServiceWorker

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.450
throughout development.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.630
An additional trick is to
stick to semantic versioning.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.360
The ServiceWorker can inspect
if the version number is only

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.300
a patch, a minor revision,
or a major revision.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.670
Based on that, you can
reload the page for the user,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.750
prompt the user to
reload, or just install

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.410
the new ServiceWorker
silently in the background.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.980
Enjoy.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.450
See you next time.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.176
Welcome to the end cart!

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:07.050
If you want to know more
about ServiceWorker,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.430
you can watch the
last livestream

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.390
