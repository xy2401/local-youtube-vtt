00:00:01.603 --> 00:00:04.019
SPEAKER 1: Here's something
that came up on "Supercharged"

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:04.600
recently.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.555
Sometimes you need to animate
a shadow on an element,

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:08.460
but you want to keep
your stuff performant.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.636
And you might think, I'll
animate the book shadow.

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:12.510
But that's bad, because
it causes the element

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.360
to repaint every
time you change it.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.651
And you can see that by
switching on the paint flashing

00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:17.900
option in Chrome's Dev Tools.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.070
Then you might think, ah-ha.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.120
Instead, I shall use
the CSS blur filter.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.816
But that's also bad
for performance,

00:00:22.816 --> 00:00:24.690
because this applies a
post-processing effect

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.470
on the GPU, meaning
it's done per frame.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.220
Since blurs are
computationally expensive,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.860
they're not something we
want to be doing on the fly.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.360
What you want to do instead
is create a totally separate

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.260
element, maybe a pseudo
element, onto which

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.912
you can bake the shadow.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.370
You can take that element, fill
it with a black background,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.212
add a box shadow,
and fade it down.

00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:44.170
Then you promote it with
Will Change Transform,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.390
making it movable
with the GPU's help.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.900
Alternatively, for a slightly
more flexible approach,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.310
you can use an SVG images,
the boxes background,

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.140
and use border image
to nine slice it.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.151
You could even use
SVG's foreign object tag

00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:57.650
if you want to go really out
there and do something strange.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.060
Now you have a shadow
that you can move, scale,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.580
and fade independently of
the elements it's shadowing.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.180
Win!
