PAUL LEWIS: Welcome to
this Supercharged TL;DW.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.144
I'm Paul.

00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:14.560
If you didn't catch
the livestream

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.976
with me [? and Serma ?]
last week,

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:17.800
well, basically we
built a side nav.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.690
Let me show you what we built.
So you've got your standard app

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.720
bar here.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.120
You click on this sidebar.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.060
And you click on the
background, or you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.960
can dismiss it with a sort
of drag gesture, like that.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.680
Awesome stuff.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.320
So let me show you
how we built it.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.150
But before we do
that, as usual, we're

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.030
going to head over to-- yep,
you guessed it-- Theory Corner!

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.650
Join me.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.260
Hello.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.540
Welcome back to Theory Corner.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.720
So this is what we've got.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.860
We've got our page, and we've
got a container element.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.452
The container element is going
to be the home for the side

00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:51.410
nav and the background.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.210
What we're going to
do, first of all,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.150
is we're going to put
overflow hidden on this.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.800
And we're going to make it
take up 100% width and height.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.597
So it's got overflow
hidden because this

00:00:59.597 --> 00:01:01.180
is going to transform
out to the side,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.570
and we don't want
any scrollbars.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.734
So we put that in place.

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:07.150
The background, we're just
going to transition its opacity

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.935
from 0 up to 1.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.060
And we'll set it to have
a transparent black color,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.497
or semi-transparent black
color, in the background.

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:14.830
The other thing is the side nav.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.510
We want this to slide
in from the side,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.230
so we need to have
will-change transform on it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.530
so that it gets its own layer.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.610
Very much like we did
with the swipeable cards.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.550
And then we can
transform it in and out.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.820
We're also going to
need some buttons

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.130
for bringing it in and out.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.610
And we're going to have to have
some touch events so that we

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.210
can do the dragging stuff.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.070
All cool?

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.050
Let's go back to reality!

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.530
Welcome back to reality.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.650
Oh, yes.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.450
Yes.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.630
Reality.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.240
That's where you'll
find us today.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.000
Pragmatic to the end.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.951
Code.

00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:44.450
OK.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.490
So the markup and the
CSS is pretty much

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.060
what we discussed
in Theory Corner.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.355
We've gotten a side.

00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:51.730
We've got a few JS classes
here so that we can pick it up

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.620
in the JavaScript.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.570
But mostly it's pretty
much what you'd expect.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.980
There's a button for closing.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.460
There's a button for opening.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.520
We've got the title
here for the side nav.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.540
And then we've got the list
of the side nav content.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.960
In terms of the CSS, here's what
we've got for the background.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.530
You see it's actually done
with a before pseudo element.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.030
And you can see that it's
got a background of black

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.670
with an opacity of 0.4.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.140
We switched on
will-change opacity

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.431
because we know we're going
to be changing the opacity,

00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:21.070
so we're going to say
will-change opacity.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.837
Didn't say will-change pasty.

00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:24.545
That would be a
different thing entirely.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.280
Will-change opacity, and then we
can set a transition of opacity

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.550
with that curve.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.560
That looks quite nice.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.620
0.3 seconds.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.720
Nice and quick.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.520
Then the other thing is when
we set the side nav to visible,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.459
which we're going to do
with some JavaScripts,

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.000
and we can say to
that before that we

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.370
want you to fade up
from an opacity of zero

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.340
to an opacity of one.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.990
The same is pretty much
true of the side nav itself.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.739
Here it is.

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.155
And you see it's
got a box shadow.

00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:55.071
So we've got a nice
little shadow on the side.

00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:57.470
The interesting thing is
we have to transform it by,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.280
in my case, 102%, which
sounds really odd.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.040
But the reason is
there's that shadow.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.310
And if you just transform
it 100% to the left,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.270
you still see a little bit of
shadow on the left-hand side.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.100
So if we just take it
a little bit further,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.580
solves that problem.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.080
The interesting
thing about the side

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.340
nav itself, the one that
comes in from the side,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.874
is that it has a separate
animatable class.

00:03:15.874 --> 00:03:18.040
The reason is I want to
switch that off when they're

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.584
doing the drag
motion and have it

00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:21.500
on when they're doing
the automated transition

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.967
from the side in and out.

00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:24.550
So we use this class
to basically say,

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.960
this is kind of-- it's doing
the automatic transition,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.620
or when it's off, it's going
to be used for the dragging.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.300
Cool.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.589
The JavaScript is over here.

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:35.130
And it's the same
trick as last time.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.094
A bunch of event handlers
that we bind on with this.

00:03:38.094 --> 00:03:39.510
If you haven't
seen why I do that,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.460
go back and watch the
Swipeable Cards TL;DW.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.400
I explain pretty much why I
do this approach to my event

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.900
handlers.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.441
You don't have to
take this approach,

00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:50.240
but it works pretty
well for what I'm doing.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.390
So we bind all those on.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.820
And you can see here we've
got the show and the hide.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.240
Now, here's an interesting one.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.280
I actually say that if
you click on the side

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.640
nav, the containing element, the
container from Theory Corner,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.640
I want you to hide the side nav.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.940
Well, that will work kind of.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.760
But then if you click on
something inside the side nav,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.700
well, that's kind of
weird because you've

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.200
clicked on something in side
nav, and it's going to dismiss.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.950
The way we get around
that is we basically

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.060
say the side nav itself,
that's going to hide it.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.190
But any clicks
inside, we're going

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.160
to call this BlockClicks
function, which

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.840
you can find down here.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.350
BlockClicks, all that does
it stops the propagation.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.390
So it's almost like
canceling the event.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.427
Now, you don't want to
do this all the time.

00:04:29.427 --> 00:04:31.760
You only want to do it when
it makes sense for your app.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.450
And it makes sense
in my case, I think.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.590
So that's all good.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.610
So I think all
that's really left

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.761
is to just have a quick
look at that drag motion.

00:04:40.761 --> 00:04:43.010
Now, if you remember, the
drag motion looks like this.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.790
We can click, and we can drag.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.240
And if we just come away
from the side a little bit

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.355
and let go, it
dismisses the side nav.

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:52.150
So let's see how
we code that in.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.380
Well, we have our
onTouchStart here.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.510
And basically, because this
is bound to the document,

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.200
I basically say if the
side nav isn't open, bail.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.020
Don't hang around.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.660
So we're going to call this any
time somebody hits TouchStart.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.460
But we only want to deal with
this if the side nav happens

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.620
to be open.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.490
And what we do, very
much the same kind

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.000
of deal as the swipeable cards.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.490
We capture the start
position, and we copy that

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.100
across to a current position.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.010
And then in the
TouchMove we basically

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.460
figure out how far
we moved, and then we

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.890
can apply a transform
in a kind of game loop

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.370
and update function,
which you can see here.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.490
There's the translate.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.950
Current [INAUDIBLE] to start.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.052
And then we apply
it as a transform.

00:05:34.052 --> 00:05:35.510
If you've seen the
Swipeable Cards,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.384
this is all sounding
very familiar, I'm sure.

00:05:37.384 --> 00:05:38.120
But it works.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.870
And it works really well.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.280
The last thing is, on
TouchEnd, we basically say,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.225
if you translate it just
a little bit to the left,

00:05:45.225 --> 00:05:48.310
hide the side nav, that
works out really well for us.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.060
One other little
thing to note is

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.790
this, in terms of
the OnTouch move,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.500
by default you'll get that
throttle back in Chrome.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.730
So you won't get
them every frame,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.900
unless the very first
TouchMove event has

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.840
an event.preventdefault on it.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.380
So what we do is we
calculate the translate.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.160
And we say, if it's
less than zero,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.350
as in you've started to move
it, we prevent the default

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.710
and that means it will get
all the updates from then on.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.585
So there you have it.

00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:15.440
That's the side nav.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.440
Pretty straightforward
in terms of these things,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.580
but this works really well.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.699
It works at 60 frames a second,
even on a mobile device.

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.240
If you haven't caught
the livestream,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.111
again, it's about an hour long.

00:06:25.111 --> 00:06:26.360
It's in the description below.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.560
So have a look through that,
and have a watch of that

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.380
if you've got a spare hour.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.420
Again, it's the
usual kind of stuff.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.190
You see all the bugs.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.064
You see all the chat.

00:06:32.064 --> 00:06:34.820
You see all the discoveries
and the kind of discussion

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.540
that [? Serma ?] and I had.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.840
