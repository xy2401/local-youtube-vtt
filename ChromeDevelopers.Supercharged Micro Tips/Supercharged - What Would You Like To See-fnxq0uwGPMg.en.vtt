PAUL LEWIS: Hey, I'm Paul.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.980
SURMA: And I'm Surma.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.646
PAUL LEWIS: Now, season three of
Supercharged is about to start.

00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:09.910
And we thought this time we'd
do things a little differently.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.620
We thought we'd ask you what
you're trying to get done.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.540
Have you tried to
add a service worker?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.247
Have you done something
with Canvas or SVG?

00:00:17.247 --> 00:00:18.330
What is it you want to do?

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.741
How do I do x?

00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:22.240
And we will try and help you
solve x live on the livestream.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.940
We'll do some love
coding and whatever.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.850
So submit your ideas
in the comments below

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.110
or to me on Twitter
as @aerotwist,

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.780
or him as @DasSurma.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.350
And we will see you
in season three.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.490
You done with the picture?

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.600
SURMA: Ah!

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.880
PAUL LEWIS: Yay!

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.430
SURMA: Ah.
