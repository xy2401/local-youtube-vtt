00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.510
PAUL LEWIS: Hello, and welcome
to this Supercharged Q&amp;A.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.380
I'm Paul.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.255
SURMA: And I'm Surma.

00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:09.713
PAUL LEWIS: Now,
today, we're going

00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:11.000
to answer another question.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.785
And as usual, it seems
Surma has chosen one.

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:14.660
What have you chosen?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.510
SURMA: I have chosen
a question once again.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.500
And this week, it
is going to be.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.090
"I'm, in general,
very interested

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.910
in gesture driven
animations that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.870
use physics-based equations.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.380
Would be great to
hear about that."

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.930
PAUL LEWIS: OK, cool.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.880
Well, actually,
as a side note, I

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.140
was playing with this
[INAUDIBLE] preview,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.450
and they've just recently added
this spring, a timing function.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.260
Have you seen this?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.420
SURMA: Ooh.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.320
Yeah, I heard about it.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.860
I haven't actually looked
at what it looks like.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.693
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, so
basically, what they do

00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:44.460
is instead of saying,
timing-function ease-out,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.870
you can say spring,
and then it's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.616
like mass, the dampening
factor, the initial velocity,

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:51.740
and a bunch of other stuff.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.910
SURMA: It sounds
really physics-based.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.430
PAUL LEWIS: It is.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.013
And the weird thing
is, at the moment,

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:57.955
you can actually put a duration
on it, and after that time,

00:00:57.955 --> 00:01:00.330
it'll just snap to the final
location, which kind of felt

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.770
a bit strange.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.140
SURMA: That does not
sound very physics-based.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.630
PAUL LEWIS: No, it doesn't.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.250
It sounds kind of
a weird hybrid.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.570
But nonetheless, it's
an interesting proposal

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.820
to introduce physics-based stuff
to existing CSS animations.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.960
But how that's going to
pan out, I do not know.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.668
What are your thoughts
on the whole area?

00:01:15.668 --> 00:01:18.230
SURMA: Well, something
that you actually

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.160
taught me, I guess, or told
me was when it looks right,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.660
it is right.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.326
PAUL LEWIS: Yes.

00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:26.614
SURMA: Which is something
that we've been employing

00:01:26.614 --> 00:01:27.530
in codes all the time.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.870
For example, with the
swipeable cards that you wrote,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.661
you just went with this
formula which said,

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:33.595
current position
minus end position,

00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:35.720
or the other way around,
divided by 4, every frame,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.490
will have a real nice
smooth out effect, which

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.450
is not physics-based at all.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.170
It isn't even
framerate-independent.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.882
But in 99% of the
time, it's going

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:47.090
to feel right to the user,
and that is the only thing

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.000
that actually counts.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.580
PAUL LEWIS: I think, yeah,
because I got that from one

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.730
of my teachers at school.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.599
When we were doing
some drawing work,

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.890
basically, he was like, if
it looks right, it is right.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.181
And it's kind of stuck with me.

00:01:57.181 --> 00:01:59.840
And yeah, I think there's
two parts to this, which

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.550
is, firstly, if somebody's
interacting with something

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.782
on-screen, it's got to feel like
it's sticking to their finger,

00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:08.240
assuming that's the kind of
feel you're actually going for.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.820
SURMA: Sure.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.540
PAUL LEWIS: After that, you
can get away with quite a lot,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.245
because it's not a real
thing that they're--

00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:14.870
SURMA: Exactly.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.490
PAUL LEWIS: --interacting
with, right?

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.698
I mean, this is the whole
idea behind material design

00:02:17.698 --> 00:02:21.280
is this kind of-- these
layers that sort of respond

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.100
sort of like a real-world
thing, but also kind of magical

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.690
as well.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.200
SURMA: It's a metaphor, and
it stops there, I think.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.410
PAUL LEWIS: Right, and
even with skeomorphic stuff

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.350
of yesteryear, it was kind
of realistic, but also

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.700
kind of not as well.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.585
And I think, as you say,
so long as it looks right,

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:38.960
or apparently from what I say,
as long as it looks right,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.160
I think it is right.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.590
And the thing about doing
something that's physics-based,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.039
generally, is there's a
increased computational cost

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.455
of doing the physics
calculations.

00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:48.690
SURMA: For the real gain.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.020
PAUL LEWIS: For arguably
questionable gain.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.610
I think--

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.943
SURMA: [INAUDIBLE] metaphrasing.

00:02:52.943 --> 00:02:55.970
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, in some
cases, it's going to be right.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.579
It's going to be the right
thing to do, depending on the UI

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.370
that you're making.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.390
But in other cases, I
think, if you can fake it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.647
and you can get close to
it, absolutely do that,

00:03:03.647 --> 00:03:06.230
and especially if it's going to
mean that you're spending less

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.760
time on the CPU and you're much
more likely to hit like a 60

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.440
frames a second animation.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.380
SURMA: And I think it's
kind of unwieldy when

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.463
you go physics-based really
fast, because you have

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:15.550
to basically pretend
that a certain item has

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.530
weight so you can kind of figure
out how fast it's going to go.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.770
So all these kind of things--

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.990
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.520
SURMA: --that get really
annoying, because you're like,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.520
I have a div.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.380
Let's pretend it
weighs five kilograms.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.740
And then you get more
variants you can tune,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.320
and it gets really
hard to juggle

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.340
all these things in your head.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.506
And I think, most of the
time, especially when we're

00:03:32.506 --> 00:03:34.710
talking about simple
UI, that it's not

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.850
worth the effort or the
computational time that

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.950
comes with it.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.790
PAUL LEWIS: Exactly.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.665
So there you have it.

00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:41.530
I think if you can do it, great.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.770
Don't stress out about it and
just give it your best shot.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.430
And I think that
most of the time,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.221
so long as you're doing
60 frames a second,

00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:52.800
stick to finger, and everything
kind of plays out, generally,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.740
quite nicely with
eases and so forth,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.227
most of the time, that'll
actually cover you pretty well.

00:03:57.227 --> 00:03:58.810

much for joining us.
