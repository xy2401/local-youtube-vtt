SPEAKER: Hello, and welcome
to the Supercharged Q&amp;A.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.100
On the YouTube
videos that we do,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.500
the most commonly occurring
question seems to be,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.894
what code editor are you using?

00:00:10.894 --> 00:00:12.810
And I thought, well,
I'll answer the question.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.917
It's fair enough.

00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:15.750
But before I do, I just
want to say, for me,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.060
it's not a big deal.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.170
I used to work-- in a
former life-- on servers.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.260
And I'd get to one
of the servers,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.042
and it would basically
have no editor whatsoever,

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:27.000
and I would just use
Notepad and fix the thing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.720
So, for me, I come from
a place where it's just

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.450
a way to mess around with code.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.750
And I like it fairly minimal.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.670
I like it to kind of be without
bells and whistles, I suppose.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.146
So with that caveat
sort of said,

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:41.020
let's actually have a
look at what I'm using.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.340
Now, in my case, I am
using Visual Studio Code,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.350
which I recently switched to
and which I think is brilliant.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.070
I love it.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.470
Let me show you around a
couple of things that I think

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.140
are really good about it.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.880
Let's say I've got this send
event function in my code.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.090
If I say new custom event or
something like that, which

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.670
is part of the web
platform, it will tell me

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.270
what I should be
putting in there.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.320
So it says-- there's
a string that

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.012
is the name or the type
of the event that it is.

00:01:06.012 --> 00:01:07.970
So I can just do, I want
the name of the event.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.886
That's going to do it.

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:11.560
And then I can use a
dictionary for all the stuff

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.530
that I need in there, like
bubbles, true, and stuff.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.450
So, for me, the
fact that it's going

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.120
to start recommending
what I should actually

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.010
put into these as parameters,
for me, that's a huge deal.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.800
I think that's
incredibly helpful.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.470
It saves me having to go
off and do reference type

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.630
stuff all the time.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.130
The other thing is
you see here I've

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.230
got the red line
under New, and that's

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.100
because I've actually got a
bunch of extensions installed,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.360
one of which is ESLint.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.832
In fact, let's just talk
about the extensions

00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:42.540
I have installed.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.100
I have editor config,
which is a very good way

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.180
of setting what the
project's settings are

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.060
that you want to use.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.990
So in my case, this is the
Supercharged code that we do,

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.770
server and I. The editor
config is fairly lightweight.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.530
We indent with
spaces, two spaces.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.363
There's a little fight
that we can all have,

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:04.360
tabs versus spaces.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.480
Whichever works for you.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.500
The character set, trim,
trailing whitespace,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.729
and insert final new lines.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.579
So, basically, this is,
like, project-wide settings

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:14.370
that I want to use.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.970
So that's a really
handy little extension.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.980
ESLint is the other one, and
that's why that code is red,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.650
because I basically do not
use New for side effects while

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.650
I'm-- just because I'm
not assigned to anything.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.710
So event equals that.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.330
And then I can just-- now it's
saying, you didn't use event,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.402
so there we go.

00:02:30.402 --> 00:02:31.360
So I'll just send that.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.901
There you go.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.820
And there's my function
actually finished.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.270
That's really nice, and now
I know there are no errors.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.449
And so for me, the
linting-- built in linting--

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.740
and, again, you can get that
with virtually any editor,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.057
so that's cool.

00:02:42.057 --> 00:02:44.640
And then, last, I'll mention the
document list, which, for me,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.806
is also a nice little thing.

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:47.590
If I just do that,
then it starts

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.475
to fill in the
[? JSdoc ?] for me there.

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:55.040
And it's saying param is that,
but I would say it's a string,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.490
so that's fine.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.460
Sends a custom event.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.500
You see how grown up I'm being?

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.392
I'm documenting my code.

00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:04.350
What's wrong with that?

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.370
Absolutely nothing.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.210
So there you go.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.407
That is as much as I
actually have in my editor.

00:03:09.407 --> 00:03:11.740
I mean, there are loads of
other things, as we all know,

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.090
that you can add, but, for
me, that's the minimal thing.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.960
I like the checking.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.760
I like this sort
of code completion,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.340
suggestions stuff that you get.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.230
And so, I mean, I recommend
it, but I'd recommend

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.690
Atom, as well, and Sublime.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.330
They're all very good.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.830
So pick whichever
one works for you.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.200
But thanks for the questions.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.470
Hopefully, now that
puts that one to rest.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.270
And I'll catch you--
probably with [INAUDIBLE],

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.830
because he'll be showing up
at some point-- next time.
