[EXPLOSION]

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.670
Hello, and welcome
to "Supercharged."

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.714
Now this is a kind of TL;DW.

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:15.880
Last week I did a live
stream with [? Surma ?] where

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.331
we made some swipeable cards.

00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:19.080
Now you probably
recognize swipeable cards

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.940
from things like Google Now,
where you just kind of take

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.024
a card and you dismiss it.

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:24.273
And you'll notice, you'll
see what I've got on screen.

00:00:24.273 --> 00:00:25.910
This is what we ended up making.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.540
You see, dismiss it, all
that kind of good stuff

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.010
Now the idea is, if
you've not got an hour

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.190
to watch that live stream
back-- although if you can

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.220
I would recommend
it, and you can

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.429
find the link to that
below-- if you can't, that's

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:37.470
exactly what this is for.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.845
I want to step
through the things

00:00:38.845 --> 00:00:40.662
that we learned, the
things that we did,

00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:42.870
and just so you can get an
insight into what actually

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.514
went into it.

00:00:44.514 --> 00:00:46.680
So before we actually get
started, what I want to do

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.020
is I want to step
over to Theory Corner.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.012
Oh yeah, theory, love theory.

00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:52.470
And what we can do
in Theory Corner

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.870
is discuss what we need to do.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.519
Join me.

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:57.560
Welcome to Theory Corner.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.518
You can tell it's Theory
Corner because there's

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:01.240
some theory in a corner.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.980
Now this is what we have.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.090
We've got the cards.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.430
You can tell it's a card
because it says "card."

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.870
The cards have will
change transform on it.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.310
The idea I have here is
that we want each card to be

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.880
transformed around the screen.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.532
And so we want to give
each card its own layer.

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:19.240
The compositor then
can move those around

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.600
with the help of a GPU.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.640
So long as we stick
to transform, opacity,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.140
and we set will change,
we should be good.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.870
So we move the card as
you touch and swipe.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.440
But as you get
across to this side,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.094
we have this marker like 0.35.

00:01:32.094 --> 00:01:33.260
Now I picked that at random.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.593
You can pick a different number.

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:39.320
0.35, if you go past that
point, we basically say, well

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.600
this card is being dismissed.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.477
So we slide it off to the side.

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:44.060
The other thing that
we're going to do

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.250
is we're going to
change the opacity.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.210
So the further you
go across, the lower

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.895
the opacity in both directions.

00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:49.960
So that works there.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.335
OK, so we're going to put
each card in its own layer

00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:55.600
and shift it side to
side and fade it out.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.115
Let's go back to reality.

00:01:57.115 --> 00:01:58.615
What we're going
to do here is we're

00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:00.010
going to step into the code.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.730
So you can actually see bit
by bit what we actually did.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.130
Here's the cards, and
what we do first of all

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.628
is we basically create
an array from the cards

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:08.919
that we've got in the document.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.740
So we'd have to have some kind
of code that adds or removes

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.855
those cards later on.

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:13.980
But don't worry about that.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.659
We'll just get on with
what we've got here.

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.200
The next thing to
notice is that I've

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.620
got these named functions
on start, on move, on end,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.510
and update.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.529
Now the first three
are our input events,

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:25.820
and I choose to do it this way.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.060
What I do is I take a copy of
it by calling dot bind on this

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.910
and that takes it
from the prototype

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.002
into the actual instance.

00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:34.710
But it does another
thing for me as well.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.060
It means that it's
bound to the instance.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.610
So that in those
functions, when I say this

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.580
dot whatever, it's actually
applying to the instance

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.920
and not to the target's event.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.780
No wait, the event's target.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.070
One of those two.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.285
So it also does
something else for me.

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:53.160
It means that I can do
the add event listener

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.380
and remove event listener.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.770
And I can call it by name and I
can say like this dot on start,

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.350
for example.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.391
You see that down here in
the add event listener.

00:03:00.391 --> 00:03:02.980
So I do add event listener for
touch start, touch move, touch

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.350
end, mouse down, mouse
move and mouse up.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.900
All of them, yay.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.680
And I can just basically say on
start, on move, on end, and so

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.920
on.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.961
And if I wanted to do the
remove event listeners,

00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:12.820
I could do that.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.840
And it would just
work out fine for me.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.050
So we've got our
event listeners,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.800
and we have a bunch
of variables here

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.630
that are just sort of
housekeeping things

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.175
that we need to keep a track on.

00:03:22.175 --> 00:03:24.550
The other thing I do is I
start the requestAnimationFrame

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.926
where I busily sort of
kind of do an update.

00:03:26.926 --> 00:03:28.550
Now if you're doing
this in production,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.840
I would suggest you don't
do it quite like this.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.734
I would start the
requestAnimationFrame when

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:33.900
the user starts interacting.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.180
And then when the
animation is finished,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.263
I would stop doing the
requestAnimationFrame loop.

00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:39.854
But for the case of this,
just to keep things simple.

00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:41.270
I just start it
right at the start

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.910
and I do a kind of
busy loop through.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.580
So what we actually do in
the on start, on movement,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.330
on end event listeners--

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.910
Wow, saying event listeners
over and over and over and over

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.770
and over again, that's
not confusing for me.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.622
No.

00:03:53.622 --> 00:03:54.580
What do we do in those?

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.160
Well first in the on start,
the main thing is this.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.990
We basically take a
marker for the start

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.780
position of the interaction.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.490
Where does the user put their
finger down on the screen?

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.500
And we get that with page x.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.060
The other thing we do is
we take a copy of that

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.490
for the current position.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.140
Because as we move
our finger, we're

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.640
going to update the
current position

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.160
so we know where we started
and where we currently are.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.589
And the difference is how far
we want to transform the card.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.560
The other things that
we do in this is we

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.260
set the dragon card to say true.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.230
But, as we discussed
in Theory Corner,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.182
we set will change to transform.

00:04:28.182 --> 00:04:29.640
Now we can check
that that actually

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.660
works by going back to the
code bringing up dev tools.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.670
And in the rendering
settings, we're

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.570
going to show layer borders.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.030
Anything that's
got its own layer

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.960
is going to go orange
around its border.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.590
You ready?

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.530
So when I click, you can see
that immediately the card

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.287
gets its own layer,
which is really cool.

00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:48.120
That means that we can
transform and move it

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.480
around cheaply like we
discussed over there

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.859
in the theory corner.

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:55.400
Here's what we've
got in the on move.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.566
It's fairly straightforward.

00:04:56.566 --> 00:04:59.740
All we do is we take the
current position of the input

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.170
and we basically said
that's the current x.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.450
Now inside the
update, what we can do

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.370
is we can say if they're
dragging the card, the screen x

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.870
which is basically the position
of the card on the screen

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.410
is the current minus the start.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.610
That's basically how
far they've moved.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.564
And we can apply the
transform to account for that.

00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:19.230
(SINGING) Ta-da!

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.581
Now when the user
stops interacting,

00:05:22.581 --> 00:05:24.080
we actually have
to make a decision.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.621
If you remember over
in Theory Corner

00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:30.280
we said, if the user is past
that 0.35 marker, so it's

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.270
sort of a zero to
one range, One being

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.210
the full distance of the
card, zero being not at all.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.890
If they go past 0.35--
which is what I've chosen,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.380
but you can choose a different
number-- what we want to say

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.590
is they are dismissing the card.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.190
And we do this by
setting a target x which

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.300
we use later on in the update.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.230
And here we do
screen x plus equals

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.307
the target minus the
current screen x over 4.

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:53.890
What this is going
to do is it's going

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.980
to ease the card to that final
position, which will either

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.474
be the center or it
will be off to the side

00:05:59.474 --> 00:06:00.890
depending on whether
we've decided

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.300
that they've gone past the
point of dismissal or not.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.120
Then there's a little bit
of tidy up that we do here.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.640
We basically normalize
the drag distance.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.510
And we use that to
set the opacity so

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.526
that the further across you
get, the more fadey the card is.

00:06:16.526 --> 00:06:17.192
(SINGING) Ta-da!

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.200
So far, so good.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.860
So the last little
bit is what we

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.309
do when you dismiss the card.

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:24.850
Because what we want
to do is we want

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.430
to slide all the other
cards into place.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.140
And we do that with
this animate other cards

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.240
into position function.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.970
Let me show you what it
looks like without that.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.400
Switch off the layer borders.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.390
OK.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.389
Here's what it looks
like without that.

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.930
You see all the
other cards just snap

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.100
into place, which you could do,
but doesn't look quite so nice.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.390
So what we need to do is we need
to transform them down quickly

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.590
to where they moved
from, which will

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.260
be the height of the
card plus the margin.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.640
We see that here.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.380
So we take every card that's
after the current one, which

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.550
is this.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.660
And we basically say
translate yourself

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.330
the height of a card plus 20
pixels, which is the margin.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.913
And again, this is hard coded
so you'd probably make this more

00:07:07.913 --> 00:07:09.190
dynamic in production.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.300
And then we basically go from
that to no transform at all.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.180
And we use an easing
of this cubic bezier

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.290
and a duration of
150 milliseconds.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.660
And all we need to do
is just say card dot

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.620
animate with those settings.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.420
And then when you
finished, we say

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.390
the animation is
complete at which point

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.340
we can just reset the
target and call it a day.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.750
And the animation is done.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.420
So with that switched
on, you can see

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.696
we get a nice smooth animation.

00:07:36.696 --> 00:07:38.070
So the only other
thing to notice

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.550
is when I'm
dismissing the cards,

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.690
you can see that the other
ones get their own layer

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.477
temporarily.

00:07:42.477 --> 00:07:44.310
This because we're using
element dot animate

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.610
and we're using a transform.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.400
And that means that
those get temporarily

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.130
promoted to their own layer.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:49.640
Cool.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.530
That means that it's also
doing the same thing that we

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.510
had over in Theory Corner.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.940
Getting its own
layer, which means

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.650
it happens nice
and performantly.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.930
And then when it's finished,
the browser automatically

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.025
demotes them back,
and we're all good.

00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:01.900
So there you have it.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.858
That's swipeable cards.

00:08:02.858 --> 00:08:05.310
If you've got time, make sure
you watch the live stream.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.268
There's loads in there.

00:08:06.268 --> 00:08:07.750
There's us finding
and fixing bugs.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.810
There's just chatting
about the general approach.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.550
All sorts of goodies in there.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.652
Hopefully you've enjoyed
