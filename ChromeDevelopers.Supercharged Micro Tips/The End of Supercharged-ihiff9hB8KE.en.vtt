00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.956
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.137
SURMA: Three years ago,
Paul started "Supercharged."

00:00:14.137 --> 00:00:15.470
PAUL: Welcome to "Supercharged."

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.309
I'm Paul.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.930
SURMA: And then I just snuck
into Paul's "Supercharged" live

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.430
stream.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.320
PAUL: I'm Paul, and
I have a little bit

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.005
of help in the form of Surma.

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.530
SURMA: The form of
Surma that is me.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.524
And then we made it a
thing at events as well.

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:28.190
PAUL: I love it.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.620
It's so good, flexbox, so good.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.900
Whee.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.139
[CLINKING]

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:33.680
SURMA: But then Paul
left, and nobody

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.830
knows why really, but that meant
that "Supercharged" was now

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.740
mine.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.370
We probably have seen enough
of Paul's face for a while,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.910
so I thought I'd just swoop
in and do a video of my own.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.915
And I think I improve the
quality quite drastically.

00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:47.930
Are we already rolling?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.616
CREW: We are rolling.

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:49.940
SURMA: Oh, good that
we have that on tape.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.440
[BEEP]

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.200
[SIGHING]

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.621
Prepare for a long day, mates.

00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:53.120
[BEEP]

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.240
And that turned out to
be really, really useful.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.740
[BEEP]

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.971
Take number 4,572.

00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:00.470
[BEEP]

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.564
Last time, we working English.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:04.063
[BEEP]

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.392
[SIGHING]

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.260
Words.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.760
[BEEP]

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.560
You'd think this is my job.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.060
[BEEP]

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.540
OK, one more and then
we finally got this.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.170
CREW: One more.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.669
[BEEP]

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:15.671
SURMA: Shows at the
[? wet ?] [? Jake-- ?] no.

00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:16.170
[BEEP]

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.340
It's just one brain
fart after another.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.280
But all good things
must come to an end.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.100
It's time for "Supercharged"
to enjoy the YouTube show

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.960
retirement home.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.390
All the live streams and
microtips, perf audits,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.920
and events are still up on
the channel in the speed

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.310
and performance playlist,
and you can rewatch them

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.720
anytime you like.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.460
I have had a blast, and
I hope you did as well.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.980
Keep an eye out
for all the things

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.470
we put out on the Chrome
Developers YouTube channel.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.200
And with that, as
always, merry Christmas.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.080
I'll say goodbye,
and I'll ask you to--

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.260
subscribe!

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.240
[LAUGHING]

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.520
Sometimes, however, you
don't really care about--

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.558
CREW: Words.

00:01:55.558 --> 00:01:57.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.200
SURMA: Ajax, [INAUDIBLE],,
you just destroyed my take

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.937
CREW: [CHUCKLING]

00:02:02.937 --> 00:02:04.270
SURMA: Who do you think you are?

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.190
It was the perfect take.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.770
CREW: We want you
to feel like a star.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.220
SURMA: Excuse me, I am a star.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.830
That does it.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.620
Thank you.
