PAUL LEWIS: This
is "Supercharged."

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.544
It's the show where I take the
sites that you've submitted.

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:24.460
And I go through them.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.080
And I look for
performance issues.

[SNORTS]

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.570
Last time, we looked at
"The Guardian's" page

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.320
load performance.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.145
This time we're going
to do pretty similar.

00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:38.270
It's going to be "The
Guardian" because we're going

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.561
to wring it for all it's worth.

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:40.785
Why wouldn't you?

00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:44.040
A little bit of something
to clarify from last time.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.200
I showed my bookmarklet,
which is really cool,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.290
to toggle the styles on
and off and switch off

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.680
the remote styles and just
leave the inline styles that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.210
were shipped with the page.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.300
There was a bug in
the bookmarklet, which

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.470
is why it was causing
some of that page content

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.730
to go a bit crazy.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.190
Who writes code with bugs?

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.010
Not me.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.430
We've updated the source code.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.840
So if you want it, you
can grab it yourself.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.390
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.210
to look, this time, at
the scrolling performance.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.990
And I'm going to
do that on mobile.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.020
Because if you've got
performance issues

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.270
on a mobile device you're
really going to feel it.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.810
You're really going to notice.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.570
And so it's a really
good opportunity

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.490
to just step in and go, well,
if I can fix it on mobile,

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.344
it's going to be amazing
and blazing fast on desktop.

00:01:27.344 --> 00:01:28.760
So it's a really
good opportunity.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.060
So I have my trusty
Nexus device here.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.790
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to unlock it, first

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.070
of all, for it is locked.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.150
I wear a lot of
hats in this show.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.080
In my job, I wear a lot of hats.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.820
This one is jazz hat.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.660
I'm going to go across
to Chrome Inspect.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.730
And you can see here that it's
showing me that Chrome Dev is

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.070
available, which is good.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.440
And there's a new tab.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.480
Ready to rumble?

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.220
Ready to-- what?

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.800
Got to put my teeth back in.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.700
(IMITATING OLD MAN)
Ready to rumble.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.060
Grab that.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.260
Let's go Open tab with URL.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.360
And click on that.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.260
And open it.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.419
And that means we can
also inspect it, which

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.640
brings up Chrome's Dev tools.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.800
Urban Paul.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.980
I'm street.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.100
I can be down with
the kids, you see.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.210
I am-- I'm cool like you.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.384
And I am on the Timeline, which
is my personal favorite place,

00:02:21.384 --> 00:02:23.550
apart from, well, maybe the
Elements or the console.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.660
I just like-- I like
them all so much.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.380
It's like choosing
a favorite child.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.964
I can't do it.

00:02:28.964 --> 00:02:30.546
I'm going to do
scrolling performance.

00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:32.210
Because scrolling's
an animation.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.170
And if there's a
problem with scrolling,

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.270
it's going to really kind
of be the most obvious thing

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.610
to the users of the site.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.370
And you know, this
is a content site.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.150
So scrolling should
be 60 frames a second

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.108
and that kind of thing.

00:02:45.108 --> 00:02:48.950
So combo hat, urban jazz.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.650
And I will record.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.980
And I'm going to
scroll like that.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.940
And every time the frame rate
drops during that scroll,

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.720
there's a bright yellow block,
which is the JavaScript.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.600
And so, you know, it's good
to know that it's JavaScript.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.580
But I think we want a
little bit more detail.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.070
So what I'll do is I'll switch
on the JavaScript profiler.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.250
OK, so we have the JavaScript
profiler switched on.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.282
Going to hit Record.

00:03:12.282 --> 00:03:14.310
I'm just going to do
a bit of a scroll.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.720
Most of the time,
I rely on editing

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.810
to sort the wheat
from the chaff.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.590
Yeah?

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.580
Wheat being the one
thing in every 100

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.810
that I say that's
worth listening to.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.090
Most of the time it's like,
(WITH HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.860
I don't like mung beans.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.540
So Timeline.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.410
Time line.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.590
The line of time.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.950
When you look at timelines,
it's often really good

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.890
to try and break down the work.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.570
And one of the things that the
JavaScript profiler will do

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.090
is it's going to color code
the results based on the file.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.470
So if you see the
same color, you

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.100
know it's coming
from the same file.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.099
And that's actually
extremely useful when you're

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.680
starting to kind
of divide and say,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.280
well, where is the
work coming from?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.030
You know, what's
responsible for the work?

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.940
So you can see, I think most
of these, lazy load, load slot,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.010
there's a message JS.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.640
I'm not sure what that is.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.019
But my hunch is that they're
trying to show a message.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.634
But it's going through Raven.js,
which that's an error catcher.

00:04:22.634 --> 00:04:24.800
So I guess that's just
acting as a bit of a gateway.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.620
Aha!

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.910
Pub ads impl.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.060
So there is something
to do with ads here.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.250
Move along to the next one.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.230
Another animation frame.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.980
More ads, Evaluate Script.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.190
There's an ads there.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.216
Let's have a look.

00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:41.530
A ready state change.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.180
So there's something going
on where there's presumably

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.160
some Ajax in.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.350
And we've got some
Parse HTML here.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.750
So that implies that
there's something

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.150
that's being lazy loaded in.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.140
But that's causing a
massive recalc style,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.320
which is pretty
intense, actually,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.140
like 117 milliseconds.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.660
And again, this is all
locking up the main thread.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.109
I actually went
through the timeline.

00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:08.400
And I think this is a really
good exercise for everyone

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.700
to do, is go through
a timeline recording.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.730
And start marking out
exactly what's going on.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.130
So in this case, there's
Outbrains, some visitor

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.870
tracking.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.230
There's some ads stuff.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.740
"The Guardian" itself
is doing a bit of set

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.735
up over multiple request
animation frames.

00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:29.110
There's a whole
block here that's

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.550
just garbage collection,
collecting the garbage,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.180
taking the trash out.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.470
I say trash.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.980
In England, it's rubbish.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.530
But one of the interesting
ones is this recalc style.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.442
You can see that it's
recalculating the style

00:05:41.442 --> 00:05:42.650
and then triggering a layout.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.770
Forcing a recalc style,
triggering a layout.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.450
And this is a really bad
state for us to be in.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.500
However, it is
third-party code and so

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.710
there's only so much
that you can do.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.520
I think the thing to
remember is that when

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.410
you're running
third-party code, it's

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.070
running alongside your code.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.670
And everybody's got contention
for the main thread,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.510
that one thread
that everybody's on.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.870
And so it's a bit
like that time I

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.280
had 10 people in a
five-person tent.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.696
That was just awkward.

00:06:07.696 --> 00:06:08.320
So there we go.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.790
I think the majority of the
issues that they're facing

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.950
are to do with scrolling
performance and the fact

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.700
that this code is not
running at a time that's

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.260
convenient for the browser
or for the user, really.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.230
You know, web performance
has never just

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.250
been about page load.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.600
It's also about
things like animations

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.755
and about responding to user
taps and things like that.

00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:28.880
So I'd take a look at that.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.680
I'd see if there's a way to just
defer that a little bit more

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.717
to when the user
isn't interacting.

00:06:33.717 --> 00:06:35.050
Don't forget, you can subscribe.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.550
You should do that.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.900
Do it.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.260
Done it?

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.780
Well done.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.863
Well done, you clicked it.

00:06:37.863 --> 00:06:38.550
Well done, yay.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.670
And you can submit
your sites, also.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.470
A good thing to do.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.761
And I will take a look at them.

00:06:42.761 --> 00:06:45.100
And I will catch you next time.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.600
Yes!

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.395
Come on!

00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:47.700
Aha!

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.700
Throw a dart, they said.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.741
It'll be easy, they said.

00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:51.210
You ready?

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.070
Miles off.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.160
Next time.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.010
Next time.
