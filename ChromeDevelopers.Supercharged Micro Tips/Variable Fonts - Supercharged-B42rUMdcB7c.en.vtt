00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.980
SURMA: Fonts-- let's talk
some more about fonts.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.590
Most designers will use a
number of different fonts

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.330
when they're
designing a website,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.510
but will also reuse the same
font using different weights,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.250
widths, or slants.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.920
On the web, that usually means
downloading an additional font

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.540
file per configuration.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.790
And that can add up to
a few hundred kilobytes

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.200
quite quickly.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.630
And this is where variable
fonts come into play.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.370
With variable fonts,
you can change

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.290
certain settings of
a font without having

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.010
to load a new font file.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.740
So for example, using
the gingham font,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.320
I can change both the
weight and the width

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.539
of the font using the font
variations headings attribute.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.330
Some settings-- that
is, width and weight--

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.280
have standardized abbreviations
that I'm using here.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.250
But fonts can expose
an arbitrary number

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.140
of settings for you to change.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.670
While it should
be used with care,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.260
you can even animate
these headings

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.960
to transition between
different font layouts.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.210
Keep in mind, though, that
this will cause the browser

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.510
to relayout and repaint, which
will become quite expensive

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.392
really, really quickly.

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:01.730
Bye.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.790
I've been continuing
Surma's analysis.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.890
And a new graph just came in.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.420
If you prefer the
yellow line, you

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.220
should be subscribing
to this channel.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.960
If you prefer the
green line, you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.269
should be watching the
latest "Supercharged" video.

00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:14.810
But really, these
lines mean nothing.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.520
You should just be doing both.
