00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.040
SURMA: Workers are the
web's version of threads.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.379
JavaScript is inherently
single-threaded, so

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.930
multi-threading works a little
bit differently than in most

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.160
other languages.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.650
Even though web workers
have been around for ages

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.080
that even Internet
Explorer 10 supports them,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.350
they are just now picking up
as a performance primitive.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.050
You create a worker with
a new worker constructor

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.400
and [INAUDIBLE] file.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.970
And that file is going to get
executed in a separate thread.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.860
Your app and the
worker can communicate

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.160
using PostMessage to send
messages back and forth.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.100
But keep in mind that you can't
access the DOM from a worker

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.370
and that you can only
send JSON-style objects.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.350
The advantage is that
you can do really

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.900
expensive and long-running
tasks in the worker,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.610
and it won't affect
the performance

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.830
and the responsiveness
of your web app.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.290
So everything that is not
essential to manage a UI

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.390
should be considered to
be moved to a worker.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.050
See?

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.490
The web even has threads.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.060
Who would have thought?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.239
See you next time.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.010
I just finished my
CommitLog series

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.470
where I built a PWA
using WordPress.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.590
So if you click here, you can
watch the entire series start

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.170
to finish and see how I
built all these little,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.580
nifty features.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.300
And while you're at
it, you should all

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.300
subscribe because we put a new
"Supercharged" every Thursday.
