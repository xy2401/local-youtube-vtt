[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.990
SURMA: One of the
most useful tricks

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.990
when working with animations
on the web is will-change.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.820
If you animate an
element, the element

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.670
will be rendered onto a
separate layer for the duration

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.990
of the animation.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.120
But sometimes, you want
that layer to stick around,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.520
because you know that you
are going to start animating

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.440
the element again very soon.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.540
That is what will-change is for.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.729
Semantically, will-change
tells the browser

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.590
that certain CSS
properties of an element

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.490
are very likely to change.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.060
So if you set will-change
transform on an element,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.820
you are telling the browser
that the transform property

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.870
will-change.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.620
See?

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.080
Most browsers react to
this by putting an element

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.810
onto its own layer, as
you can see if you enable

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.501
layer borders in DevTools.

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.500
So whenever you run into
a [? janky ?] animation

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.180
on the web, it's
worth remembering

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.700
to only animate
transform and capacity

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.500
and to set will-change.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.760
See you next time.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.290
Have you heard about
async/await, function hoisting,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.150
CSS Grid, or maybe
even [INAUDIBLE] loops?

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.414
If not, I have covered them
all in Micro Tips in the past.

00:01:09.414 --> 00:01:10.830
They are still up
on this channel.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.270
You can go and watch them.
