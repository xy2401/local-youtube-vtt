SURMA: When you are
developing your WAP

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.219
with a local development server,
build system, caching headers,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.610
and a service worker,
it gets hard to tell

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.320
if a stale version is being
served from the server

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.630
or it's just lingering
in one of the caches.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.420
Or maybe the build system
hasn't even kicked in yet.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.220
One small trick to
easily figure out

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.250
if the fault is on the client
side or on the server side

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.010
is to use cURL.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.930
cURL is a command line tool
that makes the HTTP request

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.360
and shows you the
response of the server,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.540
but you don't need to learn
all the options that cURL has.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.820
DevTools has learned
them for you.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.340
If you right-click in your
request in the DevTools Network

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.430
tab, you can select
Copy, Copy as cURL.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.620
Your clipboard now
contains a cURL command

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.750
that exactly mimics the request
that Chrome has sent off,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.410
including user agent,
cookies, compression, and all

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.840
the other HTTP request headers.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.875
Paste it into your
console and you

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:04.590
will see the response the
server sends without any caches

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.610
or service workers in place.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.930
An additional tip is
to use the dash-I flag

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.230
so cURL prints out the
response headers as well.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.540
If the response is
not what you expected,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.150
your server or your build
system is the culprit.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.980
If the response is
correct, you need

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.410
to check your caches
or your service worker.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.220
Terminal tricks--
got to love them.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.550
See you next time.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.170
Have you used Firebase before?

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.390
Because if not, I did a
livestream with David East

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.490
from Firebase, and we
built something together.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.570
You should go watch that.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.100
But you can also
subscribe to get

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.660
