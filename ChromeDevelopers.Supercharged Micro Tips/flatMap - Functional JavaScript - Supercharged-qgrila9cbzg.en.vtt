[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:09.680
[BOOM]

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:13.490
SURMA: Now that the
naming is finally settled,

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.760
it's time we talked
about flatMap.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.710
flatMap is the newest of the
functional array methods,

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.914
and browsers are
just implementing it.

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:22.580
But I expect it won't
be long until it's

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.200
available in stable releases.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.160
So let's get an early
look at this new gem.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.610
flatMap is similar
to map insofar

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.210
that it applies a function to
every element in the array.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.380
However, if this function
returns an array itself,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.680
each element of that array will
be an element of the resulting

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.430
array.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.200
That means that flat
mapping an array

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.050
can result in a new
array with more elements

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.800
than you started with.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.290
So for example,
let's say you want

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.710
to show your user the name
of the items they ordered

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.810
in the past but
your database only

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.420
has a list of orders,
each containing

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.370
potentially multiple items.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.830
flatMap comes to the rescue.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.670
We use map to pick the names
of the items from every order,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.460
and flatMap takes care
of flattening all of this

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.100
into one big list of item names.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.165
Quite handy and
concise, isn't it?

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:14.540
So if you found
this interesting,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.395
I did some more videos on
functional array methods.

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:18.770
So if you haven't
seen those, you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.700
should go back and
watch them now.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.700
