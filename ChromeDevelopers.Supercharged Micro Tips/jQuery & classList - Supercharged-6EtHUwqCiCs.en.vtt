[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.960
SPEAKER: Last time, we talked
about how the jQuery dollar

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.680
function helps
you find elements.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.300
That dollar function does not
return DOM elements themselves,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.130
though, but rather
a wrapper that

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.430
augments the element
with many useful helper

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.600
APIs that jQuery provides.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.040
For example, there are addClass,
removeClass, and toggleClass,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.540
and they do exactly
what you think

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.730
they do-- they add,
remove, or toggle

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.800
CSS classes on an element.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.690
This feature is now
present on the DOM

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.540
directly on the
class list property.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.090
This feature is sufficiently
supported all the way back

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.360
to IE 10.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.380
Handy.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.920
See?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.420
jQuery really did a lot
for the open web platform

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.100
and we have some more episodes
lined up on this topic.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.000
So if you find this interesting,
you should subscribe.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.310
Previously, we talked
about querySelector,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.090
so why not watch that
one in the meantime?
