SURMA: In a previous
episode, we talked

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.420
about how jQuery augmented
the API of dumb elements

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.430
to make developers
life easier when

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.110
it came to the management
of CSS classes.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.470
Another popular API
that jQuery offered

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.780
was closest, which
returns the closest

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.560
ancestor of the current element,
which matches the selector.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.210
For example, this
is very useful when

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.880
having a reference to a
certain button or input field

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.480
and wanting to get a hold of
the enclosing form elements.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.940
It is so useful, in fact,
that the web platform now

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.410
offers the exact same function
directly on dumb elements.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.450
All modern browsers
offer this API,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.180
and it can be poly-filled
with a couple of lines of code

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.230
if necessary.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.600
The fact that so
many APIs of jQuery

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.640
influenced the web
platform itself

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.520
shows that the jQuery offer is
for real web developers that

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.676
solved real problems.

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:01.300
What would you like
to know more about?

Let us know by
leaving a comment.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.680
I hope you have
enjoyed this trip

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.260
down this jQuery-shaped
memory lane.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.189
If you like Supercharged and
the short micro-tip videos,

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.730
you should subscribe
because there is

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.330
going to be more in the future.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.871
In the meantime,
though, you can just

00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:19.320
catch up on all things
