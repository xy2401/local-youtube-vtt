00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.950
SPEAKER: Remember when
AJAX was a buzzword?

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.320
That was around the same
time jQuery appeared

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.950
in the web ecosystem.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.360
AJAX meant nothing more than
using XHR to dynamically

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.830
load content into your website.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.120
But it turned out that XHR
is a pretty hard API to use,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.030
and jQuery provided
a much simpler AJAX

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.210
function that was quickly
adopted by web developers.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.180
Now the web platform
offers fetch,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.580
a promise-based modern
replacement for the old XHR,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.000
with a couple of similarities
to jQuery's AJAX function.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.860
This might not be
news to you, as anyone

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.900
who has written a service
worker is probably

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.280
familiar with fetch.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.550
But it was jQuery that
showed that XHR was not

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.410
a good developer experience.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.360
Fetch is somewhat
newer, at least compared

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.630
to the other APIs that
we talked about, and is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.330
supported in all modern
browsers, but not IE 11.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.550
There is, however, a
couple of high fidelity

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.628
polyfills out there
for you to use.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.162
Man, AJAX.

00:01:07.162 --> 00:01:09.370
It's been a while since you
heard that one, isn't it?

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.710
Well, if you find this whole
jQuery stuff interesting,
