SURMA: The web of 2006 was a
roller coaster to work with.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.680
jQuery was made to even
out the lumpy platform

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.290
the web offered and made
cross-browser development

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.220
easier.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.100
It did such a great job that
it was not only widely adopted

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.280
by developers, but even
browser vendors were convinced

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.950
by the usefulness of these
APIs, and they started

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.930
shipping some of them natively.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.020
Let's look at an example.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.660
Arguably, the most
well-known feature of jQuery

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.900
was the ability to find
elements with a CSS selector.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.640
Here, we are looking
for a div that

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.530
has the username class on it.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.605
This functionality proved to be
so useful that browsers brought

00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:49.440
it to the platform under
the name of querySelector

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.210
and querySelector All.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.640
You can use querySelector
in all browsers

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.280
including into the Explorer 8.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.750
And here's a little fun fact.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.550
Because so many
developers are used

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.528
to jQuery's total notation, it
is even supported by dev tools.

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.280
Neat.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.500
As you can see, jQuery
had a lot of influence

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.850
over the shape of the web.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.540
And we will talk some more about
that in the future episodes.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.290
So if you're interested,
you should really

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.820
subscribe to this channel.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.970
But in the meantime, why not
