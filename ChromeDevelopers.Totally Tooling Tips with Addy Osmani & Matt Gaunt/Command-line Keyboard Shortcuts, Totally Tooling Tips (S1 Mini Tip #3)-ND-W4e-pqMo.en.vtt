[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.700
MATT GAUNT: So the one thing
that I remember you mentioned

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.840
at one point was
command-line shortcuts,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.360
like keyboard shortcuts.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.100
That's still another thing
that I've got no knowledge of.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.160
The one thing that I hate
is when I type in a command,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.062
and I realize it's
not what I want to do,

00:00:23.062 --> 00:00:24.520
or I need to tweak
something that's

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.980
in the middle of a command
that I've already typed.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.100
And then I have to just
delete the entire thing.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.410
It just takes time.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.609
What command-line keyboard
shortcuts do you use?

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.400
ADDY OSMANI: Something
that you're probably

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.310
doing every day is using your
arrow keys to navigate around

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.050
a line.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.370
MATT GAUNT: Yup.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.161
ADDY OSMANI: Right?

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:43.710
So one thing you can do is
you can Hold-Option and then

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.410
click on a position
in the current line

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.570
to go straight to it.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.130
You don't need to
use the arrow keys.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.790
MATT GAUNT: So
Option is Alt on Mac.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.580
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.269
MATT GAUNT: Yes.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.560
ADDY OSMANI: And just click
on the position in the line

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.670
and navigates straight there.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.503
And it works, right?

00:00:56.503 --> 00:00:58.050
It's kind of useful.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.074
I also like using
pbcopy and pbpaste.

00:01:01.074 --> 00:01:03.490
They're these commands that'll
let you pipe in information

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.135
from a file, straight through
to the clipboard in case

00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:09.100
you need to use it.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.000
What other shortcuts
do I like using?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.450
Well, sticking with the idea
of navigating around a line.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.452
Control-A will move you
to the start of the line.

00:01:18.452 --> 00:01:19.160
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.440
ADDY OSMANI: Control-E will
move you to the end of the line.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.490
MATT GAUNT: How do you
just delete everything?

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.270
ADDY OSMANI: Control-U
will clear out

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.330
the whole line for you.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.120
Kind of nice.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.972
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:01:29.972 --> 00:01:31.430
ADDY OSMANI: And
you've got control

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.805
over a whole other
set of things.

00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:36.300
So Control-K can delete from the
current position of your cursor

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.300
to the end the line as well.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.670
And Control-W will
delete from the cursor

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.132
to beginning of
the current word.

00:01:42.132 --> 00:01:42.840
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.690
ADDY OSMANI: There's a ton of
different shortcuts out there.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.065
MATT GAUNT: So basically just
control hit a random letter

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:48.040
and see what happens.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.880
ADDY OSMANI: This is how you
end up deleting your code, Matt.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.590
MATT GAUNT: Shhh, it'll be fine.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.954
ADDY OSMANI: Again.

00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:56.490
