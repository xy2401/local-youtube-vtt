00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.470
MATT GAUNT: Hello and
welcome to this first ever

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.890
Totally Tooling Minitips
with me, Matt Gaunt,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.120
and Addy Osmani.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.912
ADDY OSMANI: Hello.

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:16.369
MATT GAUNT: And in
this show, we're

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.180
going to be looking at critical
rendering path, specifically

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.681
CSS.

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:20.388
ADDY OSMANI: Yes.

00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:22.005
So Critical Path CSS
and optimizing it

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.505
is all about making sure that
the stuff that you're shipping

00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:27.010
down to users makes sense
for the current view,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.680
and that you're minimizing the
number of blocking resources

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.014
that might slow that stuff down.

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:32.763
MATT GAUNT: So the way
that you'd normally

00:00:32.763 --> 00:00:35.000
do this for your website to
find out how you're doing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.330
is if you go into DevTools,
open up your network panel,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.350
select maybe like a network
like a 3G or something.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.490
Make sure you've got
this camcorder clicked,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.760
click on Record, and
then refresh the page.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.780
What this does is it starts
taking a set of screenshots

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.180
of your website over time.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.802
So once it's all done you get
a whole slew of these things.

00:00:56.802 --> 00:00:58.760
And when you double-click
on one of the images,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.760
you get to see what the first
render of your page looks like.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.957
So here after 283
milliseconds, I actually

00:01:04.957 --> 00:01:06.540
have something to
the screen, and it's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.650
got the important content there.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.840
Click through some
of the frames.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.080
So we've got a bar here.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.200
That's basically saying
that my asynchronous CSS

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.980
has been loaded.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.130
The additional stuff.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.980
We've got fonts loaded in now.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.140
And then we get the images
and it slowly comes in.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.340
And one of the things I wanted
to do with this was basically

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.010
find a way of,
well, what happens

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.650
if I removed all of the
additional asynchronous CSS?

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.990
The stuff that I didn't
actually care about.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.636
And Paulos turned in some
code that I originally

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.510
wrote into a really nice
[? bookmark loop. ?]

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.310
And when you run it, it'll
find any remote stylesheets

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.640
and just disable them so they
no longer apply to the page.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.100
So here, this is
what my web page

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.700
looks like without that CSS.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.366
So if they only got the
HTML with the inline styles,

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.490
this is what it looks like.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.737
Just the important bits.

00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:52.570
ADDY OSMANI: Baller.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.070
If you happen to have
a build process using

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.110
npm scripts through Gulp or
Grunt or whatever have you,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.880
I wrote a module
called Critical that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.510
uses some other
stuff like Penthouse.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.920
And the idea is that basically
you just throw the pages

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.545
that you need to
generate Critical Path

00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:06.600
CSS at this thing.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.621
It will generate it
for you inline the CSS.

00:02:08.621 --> 00:02:11.120
And it takes care of a lot of
the different repetitive steps

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.120
you usually have to do
to get this stuff set up.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.210
So check out Critical.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.640
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.056
And it's also worth mentioning
if you wanted to learn more

00:02:17.056 --> 00:02:18.910
about this kind of
stuff, Ilya Grigorik

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.900
has written a super awesome
set of documentation

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.050
all about the Critical
Rendering Path.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.800
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.160
Ilya also has a Udacity
course that he's

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.580
done about Critical Rendering
that's pretty awesome.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.600
It's worth checking out.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.290
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, which you
can find under the shows on Web

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.610
Fundamentals.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.240
But we'll link to
that in the video.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.031
ADDY OSMANI: Sweet.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:37.440
MATT GAUNT: Thank you.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.640
ADDY OSMANI: Bye.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.690
