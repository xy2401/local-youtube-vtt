[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.140
ADDY OSMANI: So here we
are next to a rainy river,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.665
our natural environment
for working on code.

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:17.040
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, and this
one's going to be on DevTools,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.540
so it's DevTools,
rain, and boats.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.096
ADDY OSMANI: Nothing synthetic
about this in the slightest.

00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:22.470
All right, so
today we're talking

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.000
about responsive toolbar.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.607
Now for a while
in DevTools, we've

00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:28.190
had device mode, which has been
useful for building responsive

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.950
sites.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.420
This is sort of an
evolution of that tooling.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.520
So some of the new
things we've added

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.190
are support for this
little toolbar that

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.520
lets you toggle between
different mobile sizes

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.920
like medium, large,
tablet, desktop.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.540
But we've also improved
at device emulation.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.020
So if we switch over to
Nexus 5X for example,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.482
you now get a little
bit of device artwork

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.440
from Android showing on
the top and the bottom.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.240
MATT GAUNT: Yeah,
and then they've

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.615
added an extra little dropdown
where you can then say,

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:55.780
do you want portrait with
a navigation bar, which

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.405
is like Chrome's URL bar.

00:00:57.405 --> 00:00:59.910
But you can also do portrait
and landscape with keyboard

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.660
as well, which is kind
of nice, especially

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.750
if you're doing form input,
just to see how it renders.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.040
Nice little step up as well.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.240
ADDY OSMANI: That's
kind of cool.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.656
You also have a
dropdown for being

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:10.690
able to say how
much of the viewport

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.719
you want to occupy for
your actual device preview.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.010
And we've got this little
menu with a few extra options

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.420
in here.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.794
So one of the things that you
might have tried out before

00:01:18.794 --> 00:01:21.750
is the show media queries
option, super useful.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.192
It basically parses out the
media queries in your page,

00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:25.900
and you can just see
what your page looks

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.150
like at different media
query breakpoints.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.120
MATT GAUNT: I already
have some beef with this,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.910
because if you try and use it
as is after you've selected

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.860
a device, it does nothing.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.360
But if you go to
the responsive mode

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.150
and drop down and then click
on it, then it starts working.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.150
ADDY OSMANI: What are
you talking about Matt,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.060
it's all perfect.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.184
It's all perfect.

00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:45.600
MATT GAUNT: No,
it needs an issue.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.400
ADDY OSMANI: OK, you
file a bug on that.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.900
Other things that
we include in here

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.550
include show device pixel ratio.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.930
So you can switch up your
device pixel ratio settings.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.520
Another thing that I usually
have on is network throttling.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.150
So if you're building to
be resilient against really

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.650
flaky network conditions or
Li-Fi or anything like that,

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.330
network throttling can
be useful to toggle on.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.784
Usually you can have on
a good 3G or 2G setting.

00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:15.200
And that just means that when
you're loading up your page,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.825
we're going to throttle
that connection

00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:19.790
and it will load up a little
bit more slowly than it normally

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.840
would.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.940
MATT GAUNT: And
it's kind of nice

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.510
just having that there,
because otherwise you

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.926
bury it in the
network thing, it's

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:26.050
way too easy to leave it
on some random setting,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.850
start looking at the elements,
fixing other problems.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.630
It's nice just having
it constantly there

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.720
in the responsive mode.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.900
ADDY OSMANI: You
could also-- let's

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.330
say you're building an app, like
a progressive web application,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.913
and you've got service
worker support.

00:02:36.913 --> 00:02:40.300
You can also switch on offline
to try out your service

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.850
where you can just make sure
it's working well offline.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.391
MATT GAUNT: It would be great
if it was just like one button,

00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:46.417
like disable antenna.

00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:48.250
Just an airplane icon,
that's what you need.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.360
Done.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.100
ADDY OSMANI: Folks, we're
asking about ruler support.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.870
So we've got a Show
Rulers option there.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.310
Wasn't there before,
it's now back.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.330
You can check that out
if you like rulers.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.400
Some of the newer stuff
that we've been playing with

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.560
are the ability to trigger
add to home screen.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.810
So let's say you want to
emulate your web application,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.230
manifest experience.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.355
You can click Trigger
Add to Home Screen.

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:12.230
It will bring up this
message at the very top

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.327
that says add this site to
your shelf to use at any time.

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:16.910
You can click Add
and it will bring up

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.115
a little prompt
that says, OK, well,

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:20.650
what do you want to customize
the name of this thing to?

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.200
And the idea behind
this is that it's

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.080
supposed to just emulate the
add to home screen experience

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.200
you get on Android.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.100
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, and
it was kind of annoying

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.880
because before you'd have
to do it on your phone.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.640
You'd need something to
download the manifest file.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.670
And normally the
reason you'd want

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.390
to do that is because if there's
a problem in your manifest file

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.480
and Chrome wasn't happy,
it wouldn't pass it.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.550
And it's just tricky to debug.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.010
So having this hard
way of just saying

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.440
go and download it and
pass it is insanely helpful

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.832
when you just do it.

00:03:45.832 --> 00:03:47.290
ADDY OSMANI: As a
reminder, we also

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.440
have another little
panel called Sensors

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.440
which lets you go and
emulate different sensors.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.850
So you can emulate
geolocation coordinates,

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.496
device orientation.

00:03:56.496 --> 00:03:57.870
And you can decide
whether or not

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.786
you want to emulate touch
based on your device

00:03:59.786 --> 00:04:04.210
or whether you want to do
force touch, force enabled.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.850
That's about it for
the responsive toolbar

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.550
and the new device mode.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.450
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.500
