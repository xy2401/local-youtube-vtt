00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.509
MATT: So what was your talk on?

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.550
ADDY: It was on DevTools.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.122
MATT: That you have around.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:18.830
Current DevTools.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.225
ADDY: It was on DevTools.

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:21.600
MATT: So what
like, specifically,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.309
was it like the new
stuff that's landing?

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:25.683
ADDY: It was like-- there was
a bunch of different stuff.

00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:27.729
It was like a grab bag
of new tips and stuff

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:29.770
that we've landed over
the last couple of months.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.840
There was a performance
case study in there

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.620
on the Wikipedia
editor, and there

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.090
were some more tips and tricks.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.220
MATT: Like what?

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.969
Go on and show me.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.150
ADDY: All right, I'll
show you some stuff.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.800
So another thing
we've recently added

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.424
is a feature called the
Cubic Bezier Editor.

00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:45.340
So people are probably
used to using something

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.270
like Lea Verou's
cubic Bezier sites

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.610
for like playing around with
different Bezier functions.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.190
It's like helping
visualize them.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.490
So you go in and set like
a preset you like using,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.050
see what that effect
looks like in real time.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.530
MATT: With that
particular curve.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.030
Nice.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.980
ADDY: Exactly, now, this is
sort of third-party tool.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.840
What will be even more useful
is if you just got this natively

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.820
available directly
inside your DevTools,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.570
and that's something
we've recently added.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.660
So here, for example,
I'm just going to go,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.676
and I'm going to select
one of these boxes.

00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:13.050
And what you'll
now see is we get

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.247
these nice little
cubic Bezier curves.

00:01:15.247 --> 00:01:16.830
If you click on them,
you'll see we've

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.110
got a brand new cubic
Bezier editor here.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.370
You can preview in real
time what each of the Bezier

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.610
functions look like.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.039
You can select from a
bunch of different settings

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.830
that are available.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.910
You can play around with
the cubic Bezier curve,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.660
and then you can see
what this looks like,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.590
so it's applied right
to the page in line.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.090
MATT: As you'd
expect from DevTools.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.660
ADDY: As you'd
expect from DevTools.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.370
Now another thing
that we've added

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.880
is a whole set of
different presets.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.385
So you can see we've got
Ease-in Ease-out, In [? Sine ?],

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:45.440
In Quadratic-- all
of these settings,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.170
so you don't have to
go and Google them,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.320
find them out yourself.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.150
MATT: It's kind of nice being
able to see them already

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.490
in DevTools, because,
I've got to say,

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.260
I think I normally just
stick to ease-in, ease-out

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.843
because I don't know
any of the names.

00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:55.655
That's really nice.

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:57.030
ADDY: Maybe with
this tool you'll

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.380
learn to learn some new stuff.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.690
MATT: Yeah, I need
to learn more things.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.440
ADDY: So the next one we're
going to take a look at

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.990
is the web animation
playback feature.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.830
So here we've got an
animating 3D Nintendo

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.290
controller, NES controller.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.848
MATT: Sweet.

00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:19.306
ADDY: And the first
thing I'm going

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:21.056
to do is inside of
[? stalls, ?] you know,

00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:23.650
where you can usually see all
of the different like margin

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.390
and padding and stuff
inside this box--

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.320
MATT: That's so nice.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.180
ADDY: Well, you can now see
all the different points,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.870
which the 3D objects defined.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.536
MATT: You get guidelines
and everything.

00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:31.290
ADDY: Exactly.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.320
That's not what I
want to show you.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.390
What I want to show you is
the new playback control

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.620
we've added.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.330
MATT: I don't care what
you want to show me.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.830
That's it.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.240
I'm done.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.230
ADDY: So now you can
pause your animation.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.290
So here I'm pausing
my CSS animation.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.589
I can control the
speed of playback.

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:45.880
So let's say you want to get
your animation timing just

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.130
right.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.630
This is really useful for that.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.590
MATT: Nice.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.720
So it feels like DevTools has
basically done a load of work

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.395
on animations because the
combination of those two things

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:55.615
is pretty badass.

00:02:55.615 --> 00:02:57.240
ADDY: So there's a
lot more coming down

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.370
the line on animations.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.050
I'm not going to
show you right now,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.660
but it's some neat stuff
that you might find useful.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.784
MATT: Nice.

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.450
ADDY: So another new
feature we've added

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.870
is the ability to export
your logged console messages.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.424
So we're inside the
Google I/O app right now,

00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:14.340
and it's logging some
messages to the console,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.930
but let's say that I wanted to
share this with somebody else.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.150
I can now right click
directly inside the console.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.290
I can hit Save As,
and that's just going

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.250
to export all that information.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.275
Locally, we can go.

00:03:24.275 --> 00:03:27.100
We can check it out
directly inside of Chrome,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.307
and there we go.

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:29.890
We can see all the
messages are there.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.530
MATT: Nice.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.200
Does that support console
tables and groups and all that.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.187
ADDY: I think it's for
its tables just yet,

00:03:35.187 --> 00:03:37.520
but that could be an interesting
feature for the future.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.740
MATT: Rubbish.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.880
ADDY: And another thing
I wanted to show you

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.880
was if you're in
the Google I/O app,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.820
there's a little
console Easter egg

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.660
in there first for getting an
ASCII left shark animating.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.690
MATT: You can't go
wrong with a left shark.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.800
ADDY: Oh, no, you
can spend hours

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.840
just like looking at this.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.006
MATT: Yeah, we were worried
about you the first time

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:56.969
you discovered this.

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:58.260
We nearly had the intervention.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.910
ADDY: --several weeks ago.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.010
MATT: Yeah.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.580
You need to do more work is
basically the premise of this.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.360
ADDY: You mean some
work, any work.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.040
MATT: Yeah, if you
could just turn up,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.690
that would be a step
in the right direction.
