[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.440
MATT: So I had this problem
where I was terrible

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.800
at just open source in general,
because people would raise

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.450
issues on random repos and
stuff that I'd done or been

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.140
a part of, and then I'd
never respond, because I just

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.020
never knew that it existed.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.470
And I tried the GitHub
notification UI at one point.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.790
It was super noisy.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.340
And then emails, but then
that would be super noisy.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.500
And nothing worked.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.640
Whereas Octobox is this tool
that I've found, and I love it,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.190
because it's literally stuck
with me for a couple of months,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.830
if not longer, and it's working.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.230
And I'm in love with it.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.080
So all it is is an inbox
for your GitHub issues, pull

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.420
requests, and everything.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.510
So as long as you're
watching a repo,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.160
you get a long list of all the
things that are currently-- you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.542
should be involved in or
you need to respond to.

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:00.000
And it's great,
because it tracks--

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.410
down here, all the things
at the bottom, these

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.120
are super old issues,
but I know that I

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.087
need to do something with them.

00:01:05.087 --> 00:01:06.670
Other ones, like all
the ones up here,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.920
I haven't seen they're
new, and they're all--

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.780
well, basically, I need
to do something with them.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.780
And I'm in love with it.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.930
Because as soon as you're
done with something,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.280
you just check it, mark it off.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.780
There we go.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.990
We got some new ones there.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.940
You can even start and
create a little list

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.840
of additional things.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.160
ADDY: That's super nice.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.190
MATT: But it's gotten to a point
now where I can basically--

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.850
the minute I have time to
do a load of GitHub issue

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.700
sorting out, I can just
go here, refresh it,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.140
go through all my lists, and
then get through everything.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.960
And then I'm like,
done, go away.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.751
And then later on, come
back, and then I've

00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:40.110
got a new list of things.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.710
It's amazing.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.830
If you haven't checked it
out, you definitely should.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.060
For me, I'm in love with it.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.935
ADDY: I'll be honest.

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:49.080
The ability to star specific
issues is huge for me.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.680
I gave up on the GitHub
notifications UI a little while

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.125
ago, just because there's
a lot of stuff in there.

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:57.000
So yeah, I'm definitely
to check that out.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.870
MATT: The only feature
request that I've

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.520
made to them-- although
they responded super quick.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.010
They were like, yeah, it's way
harder than you think it is.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.949
It's if someone raises a pull
request against a new repo,

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.370
say, you'll get a
notification saying,

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.290
oh, there's a new pull
request, new thing.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.840
That's fine.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.580
You can go, and you'll deal with
it, and maybe you'll approve it

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.140
or what have you and leave it.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.010
Once that pull
request gets merged--

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.570
and maybe it's a
fix or an issue,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.550
so the issue will be
closed-- you'll suddenly

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.544
get two notifications.

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.210
One will be for the
issue that's closed,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.210
and the other one will be the
pull request that's merged.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.930
There's a bit--

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.290
I could auto archive them if I
knew that that's what happened.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.720
But it's not surfaced anywhere.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.820
But beyond that, this
thing is perfect for me.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.920
I love it.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.200
The other tool, and the
reason they got a new update,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.690
is Greenkeeper.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.360
The change that they've made
it's much more integrated with

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.450
get GitHub now in terms
of just being an app,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.280
and it is amazing.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.680
So what Greenkeeper does is it
manages all your MPM modules.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.480
So if there's a new
version, it will

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.855
create a new PR that
will basically say here's

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:03.960
the version being
pumped for you.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.680
Love it.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.780
So now all you have
to do is you can just

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.750
go through their
process, configure it,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.889
and it will basically sit there
and give you all of the repos

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.180
that you want to enable it for.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.429
So you can do it for all of
them or just a select few.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.810
I just handpicked the ones I
know that I want to babysit.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.590
ADDY: So how reliable
is this in general?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.630
MATT: So I've been
using this probably

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.390
for about six months
to 12 months now,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.910
as well as the
older version, which

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.810
was just a slightly more
fiddlier way of setting it up.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.602
But it's been immensely
helpful for me.

00:03:34.602 --> 00:03:36.060
I haven't had any
problems with it.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.809
Because all it's doing
is literally going,

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:38.880
MPM is updated.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.380
Here's a fork.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.350
The only thing, I think, is
if you don't have any tests,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.040
I think it will auto approve
the pull request unless it's

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.510
a major version
bunk, in which case

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.990
they're like, this is
completely out of your package's

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.860
versioning that
you're going to allow.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.460
So therefore, we'll
just simply say

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.310
you need to approve this or not,
because it's probably not cool.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.768
ADDY: So when you
say auto approve,

00:04:00.768 --> 00:04:05.320
does that mean it will modify
your repo directly itself?

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.140
MATT: Yes, it will
approve the pull request

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.540
if your tests pass.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.050
Yes.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.690
But the flip side is what
this is actually meaning is--

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.950
let's say you said
install version 2.0.0,

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.430
and you allow any minor or
patch release to be approved.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.829
Users are already getting that.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.329
ADDY: OK.

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.330
So you're still
sort of in control.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.394
MATT: Yeah.

00:04:25.394 --> 00:04:27.060
Chances are, as well,
you could probably

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.860
configure it not
to auto approve.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.669
But like I say, if
my tests are passing,

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.960
I'm actually like, yeah, OK,
you can just bump that up.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.870
It's good.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.050
ADDY: That's kind of cool.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.340
MATT: I like it.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.590
And the plus side is if it
fails, it won't approve it.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.690
At that point, you also
know you have a problem,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.981
and then it's in my update box.

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:42.600
And then I'm so happy.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.972
ADDY: Nice.

00:04:43.972 --> 00:04:46.430
MATT: And you were saying there
was something else as well.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.240
ADDY: There are so
many tools around Git.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.790
There's-- there's Source Tree.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.440
There's Tower.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.354
Back in the day,
I used Hub a lot.

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:55.770
Hub is really nice
because it will

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.490
save you having to
type out or even paste

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.850
in the complete URL for a repo.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.410
You can just get clone dot
files or whatever have you,

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.440
and it will know to clone
your username's dot files.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.505
And it will shorten anything
else that you need to clone.

00:05:12.505 --> 00:05:14.610
It also lets you do
things like browse

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.130
the issues for the current
repository that you're on

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.140
and do all sorts of
other fun things.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.750
It's a really nice helper tool
for open source maintainers.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.030
MATT: Yeah, nice.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.280
It's kind of like a set like
of command line utilities

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.100
that you can just get.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.599
ADDY: Yeah.

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:27.420
MATT: Nice.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.630
ADDY: And if folks
are on the go,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.130
and they also want to check out
their repos and their issues

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.320
and diffs and stuff like
that, Houssein Djirdeh

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.880
released Gitpoint, gitpoint.co,
which is a react native app.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.705
It lets you-- basically,
it's a GitHub viewer for iOS.

00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:49.811
So folks can check
that out as well.

00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:50.310
MATT: Yeah.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.300
I just noticed that Octobox does
have a mobile optimized version

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.706
as well.

00:05:55.706 --> 00:05:58.080
So you can technically use it
on the go if you wanted to.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.882
ADDY: That's fancy.

00:05:58.882 --> 00:06:00.090
MATT: But yeah, I don't know.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.940
I love these little
GitHub tips and tricks

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.610
and random things that make it
a bit easier for my work flow.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.990
ADDY: So what's your
GitHub work flow?

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.115
We'd like to hear from you.

00:06:08.115 --> 00:06:10.407
We'd like to read about
any other aliases or tools

00:06:10.407 --> 00:06:11.490
or tricks that you've got.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.990
MATT: Yeah.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.150
If we can steal them,
that would be great.
