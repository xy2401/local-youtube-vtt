00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:10.790
ADDY OSMANI: So
Service Workers are

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.430
powerful for offline
caching, but they're also

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.450
really good for giving you
instant loading performance

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.284
benefits when it comes
to repeat visits.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:18.950
MATT GAUNT: Yup.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:19.741
ADDY OSMANI: Right?

00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:22.750
And you can achieve that
using an application shell

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.702
architecture.

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:24.970
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.170
That's kind of the idea of--
it's kind of separating content

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.705
from the actual visual UI.

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:31.580
So in my head, it's kind
of like in the apps,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.290
you always have the banner.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.164
You've got the Navigation
drawer at the side,

00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:35.750
you might have some other bits.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.050
That could be common through,
like, 90% of your app.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.310
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.390
MATT GAUNT: You
always want it there.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.600
ADDY OSMANI: So when we
talk about the shell,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.470
we're talking about
the HTML, the CSS,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.170
and the JavaScript that's
making up the bulk of your UI,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.420
stuff that, you know, if you
cache that, you can still

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.060
just load up content
in the very middle

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.500
and save yourself having to
constantly reload that stuff,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.820
right?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.300
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, and it's super
nice when it comes to-- like,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.150
let's say they're visiting
a page they've never been to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.840
before.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.850
If you know the layout's
always going to be the same,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.683
you can still load that
while you go and get

00:01:00.683 --> 00:01:02.060
the content in the background.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.518
ADDY OSMANI: And
it just makes sure

00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:06.180
that your user has really
good perceive performance.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.210
So the first time
you upload, you're

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.480
going to have to render
the shell itself.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.280
You'll cache that in
your Service Worker.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.821
And you might show
like a toast, just

00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:18.100
to let them know, hey, this
application now works offline.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.600
And that means that when they
come back another time-- like,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.860
let's say they're
in Airplane mode--

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.102
that shell will load up
really, really quickly.

00:01:25.102 --> 00:01:26.560
And then it might
go to the network

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.220
to fetch the rest
of the content.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.900
You can then cache that content
so that that entire view

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.938
is then available whenever
they try accessing it

00:01:33.938 --> 00:01:35.146
without a network connection.

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:36.229
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.530
Spot on.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.290
ADDY OSMANI: We've
got some performance

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.470
testing we've done with the
application shell model.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.850
This is using WebPagetest.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.550
So on first visit, we've
got a relatively fast time

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.974
to first meaningful paint.

00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:51.640
MATT GAUNT: And this
is super important,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.731
because I think there can be
scenarios where someone might

00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:57.230
take advantage of Service Worker
to be like, ah, don't worry

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.000
about your first load.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.560
Well, I'm just going to serve
up, like, megabytes of stuff

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.656
that I'm going to cache.

00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:03.030
Afterwards, you'll
be super fast.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.830
But that first load, if that
takes so long to the point

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.530
where the Service Worker
doesn't even get registered,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.810
that's pointless.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.190
And plus, for
other browsers that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.750
don't support Service
Worker, you're

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.570
then kind of just
damaging yourself.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.710
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah, that's
going to make your users go

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.630
and cry in a corner.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.005
MATT GAUNT: Exactly.

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:17.540
ADDY OSMANI: You
don't want that.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.760
MATT GAUNT: So you still
want to be serving up just

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.410
that static render of your
site just so then it just loads

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.530
up as fast as humanly possible,
and then progressively

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.150
enhances Service Worker to
then use the app shell model.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.880
ADDY OSMANI: And if you are
using the app shell model,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.540
as you can see here, we've got
really good-- we've actually

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.160
slashed our load times for first
meaningful paints on repeat

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.330
visits.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.560
Speaking of actually taking
a look at what impact

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.120
server-side rendering
has on this,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.037
you don't have to use
Service Worker to actually

00:02:45.037 --> 00:02:46.120
be able to get good gains.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.602
If you're building with the
app shell model in mind,

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.060
with server-side
rendering in mind,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.610
you will get a really good
first paint even in Safari

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.287
and on mobile Safari on iOS.

00:02:56.287 --> 00:02:58.370
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, all the
other browsers that just

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.480
don't have Service Worker.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.440
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.910
Now, if you're
wondering, OK, well,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.534
should I be using
the application shell

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.809
model on all of my
applications, there

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.100
are going to be types of
apps-- like super simple apps,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.176
this might be overkill.

00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:11.800
But if you're building
something that's

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.440
a little bit more complex,
a little bit more dynamic,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.106
this type of model
makes a ton of sense.

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:19.839
At Google, we're using
it for things like Inbox.

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.130
It's working really well there.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.500
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.840
I think it's one of
those things-- you end up

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.760
falling into the-- sitting
there and figuring out

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.593
whether it makes sense
for your site or not.

00:03:26.593 --> 00:03:28.880
But I think it's a
good overall model that

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.910
works for a lot of
different scenarios.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.000
ADDY OSMANI: There's a
whole ton behind this model

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.810
that it would be way too much
to explain in just one video.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.150
But we wrote up a pretty
amazing article on this,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.330
if we do say so ourselves.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.150
MATT GAUNT: Well, you wrote
it up and I just read it.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.260
ADDY OSMANI: You just added
your name to the end of it.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.550
MATT GAUNT: Yeah,
that's how I roll.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.591
ADDY OSMANI: Pretty much.

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:46.717
The impact.

00:03:46.717 --> 00:03:47.800
That's worth checking out.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.910
MATT GAUNT: That's the
format of this show, Addy.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.490
ADDY OSMANI: It's a
mediocre article at best,

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.600
but it's got pretty graphics.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.490
MATT GAUNT: Yes, it does.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.400
ADDY OSMANI: People should
go check that out, learn more

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.140
about app shell.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.082
MATT GAUNT: And then there's
also the Getting Started Guide

00:03:57.082 --> 00:03:59.290
for your first [INAUDIBLE]
web app, where it actually

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.610
talks about the
application shell model,

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.270
how you can take
advantage of it,

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.070
as well as how it
applies to the demo app

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.770
that you can build in
this lovely code lab.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.120
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.520
And in that article,
we also link out

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.980
to tools that can help you get
started with the application

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.810
model like really quickly
that we're working on.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.287
So check that out.

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:16.870
MATT GAUNT: Yeah,
build a weather app.
