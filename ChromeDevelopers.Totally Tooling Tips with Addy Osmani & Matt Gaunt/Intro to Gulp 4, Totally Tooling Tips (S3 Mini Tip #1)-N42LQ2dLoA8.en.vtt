00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.522
ADDY OSMANI: So today we're
going to talk about Gulp 4.

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:13.980
I thought I would
visualize what it

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.535
feels like to be in the
JavaScript tooling ecosystem.

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:17.910
MATT GAUNT: I'm
not going to lie,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.324
it's not the greatest
intro to Gulp 4 right now.

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:21.990
ADDY OSMANI: What are
you talking about?

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.470
There's babies here
that are reminding us

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.450
how great it is to upgrade to
Babel 6 and worry about WebPack

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.790
and be told that you have
to rewrite your Gulpfile

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.814
into an NPM script.

00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:33.510
MATT GAUNT: That
sounds like Jake, yeah.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.040
ADDY OSMANI: Although it's
probably too late because Make

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.940
is back in fashion.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.700
MATT GAUNT: No it's not.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.866
ADDY OSMANI: Today we're
going to talk about Gulp 4.

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.580
We've been using
Gulp for a while

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.730
over in our Web
Starter Kit project,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.850
hitting up ES 2015
in our Gulpfile.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.130
And that's been fun.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.260
So before we talk
about Gulp 4, we

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.800
should probably talk about
Gulp 3 and some of the problems

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.910
that Gulp 4 tries to fix.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.510
So Gulp 3 would allow you to
define a dependency to a task.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.895
So here we've got
scripts and styles.

00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:02.270
And Gulp 3 would just make
sure that the dependency tasks

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.964
got executed before the
original task got triggered.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.130
So we've got a default task.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.171
We want to run our scripts
and styles in parallel

00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:10.060
and then run the default task.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.060
Now those tasks
themselves could also

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.760
have dependencies of their own.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.280
So you might want to make
your scripts and styles,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.010
clean the original
build directories.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.580
You can start off on
a really blank slate.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940
Now Gulp 3 was smart
enough so that if it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.410
saw the clean was a
dependency of two tasks,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.700
it would make sure that
it was only executed once.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.210
So all that work
was only done once

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.010
for maximum concurrency,
which was kind of cool.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.990
But this approach
had some problems.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.910
Execution of that
dependency set up

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.660
becomes a little bit
mandatory once you've

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.300
got it set up this way.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.270
It's tricky if you've got
watchers or file listeners that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.180
are going to be looking
at one type of file,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.839
like your JavaScript
for example.

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:50.380
[? It mostly ?] made
changes to that,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.410
and then it just blew away
all of your stylesheets

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.368
in your dist directory.

00:01:53.368 --> 00:01:55.200
It's not exactly what you want.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.700
And it can be tricky to
sequentially execute tasks

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.314
unless you're using something
like the run-sequence plug-in.

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:03.980
MATT GAUNT: I think most people,
whenever they have a Gulp task,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.340
I would be surprised if
anyone got away with not

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.544
having run-sequence in it.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.210
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah,
run-sequence was sort

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.220
of a life saver for a while.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.515
And using run-sequence looks
a little bit like that.

00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:16.640
But we're going to skip
over it because you're here

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.210
to care about Gulp 4.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.130
So Gulp 4 drops the dependency
parameter, the square brackets

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.036
syntax completely.

00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:25.910
And it replaces them
with execution functions

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.951
that you can use instead.

00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:28.410
So drum roll.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.910
Do we--

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.030
[FINGERTIP DRUM ROLL]

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.750
MATT GAUNT: That's what you get.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.190
ADDY OSMANI: We have no budget.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.510
OK, so we now have gulp.series
for sequential execution

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.640
and gulp.parallel for
parallel execution.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.140
And these let you
have parameters,

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.880
name the task to execute,
another function to execute.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.630
So they're pretty flexible.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.995
Now if you want to go and
start using Gulp 4 today,

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:52.370
you're first of
all going to want

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.540
to uninstall your global Gulp
3 CLI and your local version

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.640
of Gulp, or just install Gulp
4 locally and use your NPM run

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.750
scripts to run
instead, if you wanted.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.610
Some people want to do that.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.400
Otherwise just go and
install Gulp 4 CLI

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.200
globally and locally.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.310
These instructions are
correct as of the time

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.150
that we're recording
this screencast.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.860
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, do
the NPM info Gulp CLI.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.580
See if it's version 4.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.967
If it is, just install it and
ignore these instructions.

00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:25.300
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah, hopefully
by the time this comes out,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.160
Gulp 4 will either be
stable and the community

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.250
won't have replaced it with
something totally different

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.050
and it will still be relevant.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.700
But assuming that we are, taking
a look at one of those lines

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.650
we looked at earlier.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.710
If you want to execute styles
and scripts in parallel,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.630
that's as simple as this.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.875
And if we wanted to rewrite
some of those larger lines

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:48.750
that we had earlier,
they'd look a little bit

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.460
like this, if we were going
for maximum concurrency

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.579
and replaced all of
our dependency arrays

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.370
with gulp.parallel.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.904
Dies this look good, Matt?

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.320
MATT GAUNT:
Originally I said yes,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.080
but I can see your next slide.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.147
So I know it's not.

00:04:03.147 --> 00:04:04.230
ADDY OSMANI: No, it's not.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.900
This is in fact wrong.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.350
It causes a ton of problems.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.290
So the dependency for our clean
here is still hardwired in,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.770
and actually gets called
every time whether we

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.800
call scripts or styles.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.620
Gulp 4 doesn't do a
dependency check here

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.450
because they're not
really dependencies.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.880
So your clean gets
executed twice.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.500
Now to get the original
execution order,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.090
we want to do clean.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.720
Then we want to run styles and
scripts in parallel, and then

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.090
our default task.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.290
And we can achieve
that using this.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.080
So here, using a combo of
gulp.series and gulp.parallel,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.010
we can first of all
make sure that each step

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.010
is done concurrently and
combined in a gulp.parallel.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.750
And everything else can be
done in a gulp.series function.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.280
So the execution
order at default

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.819
stays the same as before,
but all the other tasks

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:51.860
can be used on their own.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.220
So you can run Gulp
scripts, Gulp styles,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.120
and not be bound on
those dependencies.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.420
It's kind of nice.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.150
MATT GAUNT: This is where I
kind of come back to the point.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.191
Like it's super clear
what's happening with that.

00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:06.369
Whereas before you could
argue it's kind of by chance

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:07.910
that Gulp 3 is doing
the right thing.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.885
It's not explicit.

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:11.260
ADDY OSMANI: So we talked
about run-sequence a little bit

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.890
earlier.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.035
If you want to move over
from the old run-sequence

00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:19.040
to the gulp.series
and gulp.parallel,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.220
here is one example of
what that looks like.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.470
We're going to skip over
that because there's actually

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.480
some decent blog posts out
that talk about moving over

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.460
to Gulp 4.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.281
There is the fettblog.eu post
that we cribbed some examples

00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:32.780
for.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.360
But these guys have actually
got some really, really nice

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.180
diagrams explaining the whole
execution flow in Gulp 4

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.340
and comparing it to Gulp 3.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.350
So check that out.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.500
There's also the We Are Wizards
migrating to Gulp 4 example.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.300
They include code
diffs and stuff,

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.050
which are kind of
useful and kind of nice.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.300
So hopefully this
video was useful.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.650
And if you follow their
guidance, not our guidance,

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.150
because our guidance
probably sucks.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.820
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, you'd be
broken with our guidance.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.790
ADDY OSMANI: You'd
be broken I guess.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.632
You too can be
ballin' with Gulp 4.

00:06:02.632 --> 00:06:03.590
MATT GAUNT: Happy baby.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.298
ADDY OSMANI: Yay.

00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:08.140
