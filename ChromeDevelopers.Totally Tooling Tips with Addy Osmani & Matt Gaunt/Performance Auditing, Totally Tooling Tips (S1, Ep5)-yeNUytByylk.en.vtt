[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.310
ADDY: So the web is getting fat.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.310
Accidental slowness is a
problem that a lot of us face.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.375
You, in the general slowness,
most people in the performance

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:21.700
side of the things.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.580
MATT: That's fair.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.754
I deserved that.

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:25.045
ADDY: Performance is important.

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:25.700
MATT: Yeah.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.250
ADDY: Like, it's very
easy to go and ship

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.750
a site that contains
a ton of images

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.615
and not realize just how slow
that is, especially on mobile,

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:35.010
where people have got, like,
limited network connections

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.360
and limited bandwidth.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.880
MATT: And this is where the
picture elements also-- they're

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.630
kind of coming in to
help with all of this

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.240
but it still-- there
are still images

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.380
that have to be downloaded.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.120
ADDY: Even then,
people should probably

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.030
have a good image optimization
workflow inside their

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.184
build pipeline.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.600
Just something
simple to make sure

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.740
that you're trimming down
the fat of what you're

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.180
shipping down to your users.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.630
MATT: Well, because you never
really notice a difference

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.130
anyway.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.660
It's just literally free
time that you were just

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.341
saving a user.

00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:01.840
ADDY: No.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.400
MATT: Yeah.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.739
So what do you use to
optimize all your images?

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.980
ADDY: So I usually use--
in my build process--

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.670
I'm usually using something like
Imagemin, which is a tool that

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.120
can figure out-- like, it's
got some opinionated choices

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.510
about how to optimize images
like PNGs and JPEGs and GIFs.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.990
I think it's using, like,
OptiPNG and JPEGmini,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.121
and Gifsicle.

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:21.620
MATT: Yeah.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.560
ADDY: But if all of
that sounds totally

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.987
crazy to you, another
really nice desktop tool

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:27.570
is ImageOptim.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.397
MATT: Yep.

00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:30.230
ADDY: So ImageOptim is
cool, because it just

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.470
means that you just take
a directory of images,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.106
drop it in, it'll do some
magic, and you can just

00:01:35.106 --> 00:01:35.730
re-upload them.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.830
You're done.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.920
MATT: So I mostly
use Grunt Imagemin.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.640
I use all of that, and it
works absolutely great.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.919
I've seen ImageOptim.

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:48.710
That's great whenever
I'm doing prototypes.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.877
Just drop it in there.

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:51.460
The one thing that
I've ended up doing

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.839
is using ImageMagick
to auto-generate images

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:55.630
of different sizes.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.970
ADDY:Right.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.894
MATT: They've actually
got a strip metadata

00:01:57.894 --> 00:01:59.310
command in there,
and it literally

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.170
does a lot of what
some of the tools do,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.762
so it's just at
least stripping out

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:04.720
some of the additional
stuff that's not needed.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.240
ADDY: When you're talking
about stripping stuff out,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.093
you talk about,
like, SVG, I guess,

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:09.509
where you've got
a ton of metadata

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.660
that tools usually include.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.160
MATT: Yes.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.614
It's just like, oh, this is
made by Inkscape or Sketch.

00:02:13.614 --> 00:02:15.030
It's just like,
the person doesn't

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.920
care that's viewing it--

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.310
ADDY: Yeah.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.351
MATT: --so get rid of it.

00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:20.210
The obvious other
tool is WebPagetest.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.340
ADDY: So WebPagetest
is kind of awesome.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.420
Really, really helps
with, like, making sure

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.760
that you're hitting
decent speed index scores.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.540
Quick tip there-- if
you're trying to, like,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.820
do any sort of
benchmarking WebPagetest,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.504
and you just do a single--
a single run multiple times

00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:37.920
over-- you might
find that there's

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.960
a bit of a difference in scores.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.220
So WebPagetest has
this advanced option

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.840
where you could run the same
test multiple times over,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.100
then just average out the stuff.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.631
I use that.

00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:48.630
Find it pretty reliable.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.980
Maybe you would too?

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.620
MATT: Yeah, I tend to
find that WebPagetest

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.920
is almost like PageSpeed
Insights, but just on speeds.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.900
It's just you've got
so many more options,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.500
so much more details.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.380
And, depending on
where you are in terms

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.320
of trying to trim
performance, WebPagetest

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.180
is great for highlighting
simple things,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.680
like, hey, you know what, you
should be enabling compression

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.540
with just GZIP, and it's just,
like, that is a one-line change

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.897
in a hasty access file.

00:03:12.897 --> 00:03:14.980
WebPagetest is literally
like, yo, you're not even

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.550
getting your first
file down to here

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.100
or your first render isn't
until, like, three seconds in.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.890
ADDY: The video filmstrip
in WebPagetest is amazing.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.147
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:23.147 --> 00:03:24.980
ADDY: Really, really
useful for, saying, OK,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.480
how many seconds
is it going to take

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.880
before my user can actually
even interact with my page?

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.479
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:31.270
ADDY: Good for
[? perceived ?] performance,

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.784
good for just being
able to see what

00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:33.950
your users are going to see.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.241
MATT: One last thing I'm
going to say about WebPagetest

00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:38.550
they've just added in is
the cost of your site.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.630
And it literally just says
this is the number megabytes.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.420
This is what it equates to.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.890
Someone in that country
downloading your site.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.360
Like for me, it's $0.22
from "Venoowata," Vanuatu--

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.650
I don't know-- somewhere.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.274
And it's just, like--
it's interesting,

00:03:54.274 --> 00:03:56.910
because if you've got a massive,
huge site with tons of images,

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.260
people in other countries
may not actually

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.110
be able to afford
viewing your site.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.230
Anyway, I ran your site
through PageSpeed Insights.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.345
ADDY: Oh, no.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:08.610
MATT: And someone was doing
a little cheeky, small bit

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.280
of cheating, really, aren't you?

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.900
ADDY: I wouldn't
call it cheating.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.925
I would say I'm giving
people a fast path to see--

00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:15.830
MATT: A fast path.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.890
ADDY: --to seeing my home page.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.390
MATT: So you've added in
a site, which is basically

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.140
very limited in functionality to
increase your PageSpeed score,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.640
haven't you?

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.620
ADDY: Someone called it a
landing page or a hero page.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.850
MATT: Because when you actually
run it, addyosmani.com,

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.700
what happens is, you've
actually got a redirect--

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.915
you should never have a
redirect for any website--

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:41.570
ADDY: No, no, you shouldn't.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.736
MATT: --if you can avoid it.

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:45.040
And your one goes,
addyosmani.com,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.771
that jumps to
www.addyosmani.com/blog

00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:50.020
ADDY: I like-- I like to see--

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.300
MATT: That then goes to
www.addyosmanni.com/blog/,

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.750
so there's a slash on the
end, that's important.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.220
And then it's gone
addyosmani.com/blog/,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.200
so you've managed to go
from your home page to three

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.290
different versions
of your blog URL.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.530
ADDY: I like to think
of my site as a learning

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.660
ground for anti-practices.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.862
