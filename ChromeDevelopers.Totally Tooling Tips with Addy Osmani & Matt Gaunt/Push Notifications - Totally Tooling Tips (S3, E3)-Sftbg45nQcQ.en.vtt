00:00:08.586 --> 00:00:11.210
ADDY OSMANI: So my friend's
son does this really cute thing

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.312
where they install
games on their phone.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:14.770
And then for weeks
after, they keep

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.853
getting notifications
saying that their village is

00:00:16.853 --> 00:00:18.170
under attack.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.711
Can you do that on the web?

00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:20.710
MATT GAUNT: Now you can.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.400
ADDY OSMANI: Now you can.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.900
How?

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.316
MATT GAUNT: Basically
what happens

00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:24.910
is you register
your service worker.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.010
You then ask it to subscribe
these to push message.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.640
Shows a little
dialog saying, do you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.340
want to allow this
to happen, yes or no?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.340
So hopefully then the
kids won't actually

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.910
enable this at that point.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.560
But if they do,
then at that point,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.480
you'll get a special token.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.720
So that user-- send
that to your server.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.430
Keep it.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.010
When you want to trigger
a push notification,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.190
you can then use that endpoint,
send it a specific request.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.370
And that will basically
wake up the service worker

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.460
on that user's device.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.367
[? Go call. ?] There's
a push message.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:53.700
What do you want to do about it?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.700
At that point, you can
just show a notification.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.580
You can go back to the
server and say, hey,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.002
what was this for?

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:00.790
You show your
notification, and then you

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.861
can respond to click events.

00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:03.610
ADDY OSMANI: Nice.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.020
MATT GAUNT: So that's literally
the whole enter and flow,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.920
start to finish.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.110
ADDY OSMANI: So can
push notifications,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.910
with the push API, can
they show me images?

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.220
Can I include content in there?

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.011
What can I include?

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.170
MATT GAUNT: So you can
do Title-- title text.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.200
You can do body text.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.830
You can have an image to the
side of the notification.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.690
And you can also do
buttons now as well.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.149
So you can actually
add two buttons

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.148
that you can respond to.

00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:27.620
ADDY OSMANI: So I
can show an image

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.220
showing that my village is on
fire but also a button to--

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.370
MATT GAUNT: Extinguish
the fire or watch it burn.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.860
ADDY OSMANI: Watch it burn?

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.480
MATT GAUNT: I don't
know what you're into.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.630
ADDY OSMANI: This got
very dark very quickly.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.390
MATT GAUNT: It's
also interesting,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.710
because now we're looking at
doing native notifications

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.370
for Mac, which is
really nice, because it

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.580
means that we get rid of our
own notification center thing.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.072
We're now going back into
native notifications and their

00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:53.905
[? trades ?] and whatever
else goes with it.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.363
ADDY OSMANI: And
push notifications

00:01:55.363 --> 00:01:56.830
are not a Chrome-only
thing, right?

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.455
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:01:57.455 --> 00:01:59.464
So they're in Chrome and
Firefox at the moment.

00:01:59.464 --> 00:02:01.130
I think other browser
vendors, once they

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.629
start doing service
worker, they can

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:03.830
start looking at it as well.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.130
ADDY OSMANI: Sweet.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.130
MATT GAUNT: There is some
bad stuff with Chrome.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.210
And since we use GCM, so we
have some proprietary bits.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.554
ADDY OSMANI: What's this GCM?

00:02:12.554 --> 00:02:14.914
MATT GAUNT: GCM-- good point--
Google Cloud Messaging.

00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:15.580
ADDY OSMANI: OK.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.742
MATT GAUNT: I've been drinking
the Kool-Aid for too long.

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:19.760
So there's some proprietary
bits you have to do for that.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.882
But again, there's
new specs that

00:02:20.882 --> 00:02:21.790
are coming out with the old.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.555
Wipe all of that out,
because the moment

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:25.430
you have to go into
Google Developer Console,

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.920
you have to register
for an API key.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.789
All that's going to go away.

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.330
So you just have
one API, one set way

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.329
of doing this that all
the browser windows going

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.480
to then take and use.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.980
It's going to be so much better.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.480
ADDY OSMANI: If I'm
correct, we have

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.070
a codelab on push notifications
as well people can check out.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.570
MATT GAUNT: Yes, which is well
worth doing, because that one

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.240
is regularly kept up to date.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.940
I think my old blog
post at this point

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.430
has probably seen better days.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.200
ADDY OSMANI: So
basically you're saying

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.139
don't visit your blog
under any circumstances?

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.680
MATT GAUNT: No,
that's just a blanket

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.740
rule for all of my content.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.720
But yes, that's what I'm saying.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.690
But yeah, there is a blog
post, and it'll step you

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.648
through all the guides.

00:02:56.648 --> 00:02:59.789
And it also goes through GCM and
how to set all that stuff up.

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.764
So yeah, go check that out.

00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:03.960
ADDY OSMANI: Oh,
and if someone wants

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.920
to simulate push notifications,
DevTools lets you do this,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.485
I think.

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:09.980
MATT GAUNT: Does it?

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.063
ADDY OSMANI: Yes, it does.

00:03:11.063 --> 00:03:11.770
MATT GAUNT: Mm.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.870
Oh, is that the bell icon?

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.610
ADDY OSMANI: It's the bell icon.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.720
MATT GAUNT: Yes,
and you can do that

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.620
from service worker in tools.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.370
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.770
