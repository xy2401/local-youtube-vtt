00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.690
ADDY: Security is a
lot like car insurance.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.232
Most people don't
want to pay for it.

00:00:22.232 --> 00:00:23.231
MATT: I agree with that.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.730
ADDY: Some people
don't pay for it.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.990
MATT: So here's the thing.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.320
For me, I don't mind
paying for car insurance

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.360
because it means that
if I destroy my car,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.710
or it gets stolen, you
get your money back.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.580
And then it's fine.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.011
It's sort of an investment.

00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:36.510
The thing that I
don't like about it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.950
is, I'm not going to read the
massive 50-page long legal

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.950
document they send you
in the process of getting

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.580
said car insurance.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.260
I'm fine with it happening, the
payment going out to get it.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.510
It's everything around it.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.167
ADDY: I never read
those agreements.

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.500
I'm not even committed enough
to read the iTunes license

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.620
agreement.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.130
MATT: And yeah, that's
basically exactly the same thing

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.560
as I've done for my site.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.720
The whole point of SSL
is to keep users secure.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.519
And Service Worker, it does
actually make a lot of sense.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.784
Because you're going to
have something controlling

00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:07.950
your page in the background.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.160
And if someone can
get in the middle,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.590
and then swap out
Service Worker,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.700
like addyosmani.com/blog
could go straight to my site,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.520
my blog posts.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.470
ADDY: What?

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.450
MATT: I could steal
all your ad revenue.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.949
ADDY: If anything,
it would probably

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:23.910
be an improvement
in content quality.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.370
MATT: Not true.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.030
But I can understand
the main point of it.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.250
The problem I have
with all of this

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.380
is it's really hard
to learn about SSL.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.010
A, there's tons of old content.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.910
This is how you set
up SSL on your site.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.020
It's useful, but it's old.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.070
And then secondly, there were
so many different factors

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.960
to the whole thing.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.760
ADDY: So when I was trying to
set this stuff up on my site--

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.950
and I don't even default to
HTTPS just yet, because there's

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.320
still-- I still don't know how
to handle all the mixed content

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.520
security warnings I'm getting
from the third parties

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.100
I'm loading, like widgets,
and share buttons, and from.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.720
MATT: Yeah.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.010
ADDY: And it's like all
the tooling around this

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.690
is sort of a minefield to me.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.510
I find it hard to
navigate those waters.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.850
MATT: So I've literally--
I've done numerous steps

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.970
into how I got it on my site,
and even then, I've got issues.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.700
So the first one was SSL labs.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.990
You just bung in your URL.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.830
And it will look at
your site and figure out

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.250
whether HTTP redirects
to HTTPS, and just

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.950
the configuration of
HTTPS on your site.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.880
So if I bung in gauntface.com in
SSL labs, I was, at one point,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.930
getting a glorious A-plus,
which I was very happy about,

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.690
and now I've been
downgraded to a C.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.210
ADDY: Have you changed
your site a lot?

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.710
MATT: No.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.210
So--

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.350
ADDY: Is there a way of--

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.750
MATT: So what's
happened is there

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.150
was the POODLE vulnerability.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.120
And I think that's
basically all through SSL3.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.430
And I've still
got SSL3 support--

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.059
ADDY: Oh, I see.

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.850
MATT: --on my site.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.183
So even though everything is
actually doing really well,

00:02:54.183 --> 00:02:58.260
like 190's for the scores
on each top-level topic,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.300
they've kept me to a C
because of SSL3 and POODLE.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.760
ADDY: I guess it's cool that
they're keeping it up to date.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.040
MATT: Yeah, so this
is the nice thing,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.760
is you can keep on regularly
running through this,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.080
and will keep it up to
date and track everything.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.280
The really nice thing with
this is it's really good.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.190
It's a ton of information,
possibly too much.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.790
But at the same time, things
like protocols, it's saying,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.750
do you support SSL2?

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.250
No.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.190
Do you support SSL3?

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.689
Yes.

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:23.571
It's insecure.

00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:25.320
These are the cipher
suites that you have.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.010
And it literally-- if there's
one particular thing that

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.540
is, like, this is actually
really a bad practice,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.330
it highlights it.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.790
And then you can at least
go and Google and find out

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.962
the problem.

00:03:33.962 --> 00:03:35.670
So this was the first
thing that I found.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.461
I was like, sweet,
these are all the places

00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:42.220
that I suck, and overall I'm
doing bad, well, or whatever.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.970
The best thing I found after
this was the Mozilla SSL

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.620
configuration generator.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.907
And this thing is a godsend.

00:03:50.907 --> 00:03:52.490
ADDY: Does it do all
the work for you?

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.600
MATT: Yes, so good.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.760
So basically, one of the
issues that I had was,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.230
how do I know what a
good SSL cipher suite is?

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.147
And SSL labs tells
you good or bad.

00:04:01.147 --> 00:04:02.730
The problem is, it
doesn't necessarily

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.080
tell you the right names to
put in your configuration file.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.220
Enter a Mozilla SSL
Config Generator.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.100
So you can select,
like, Apache or Nginx.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.310
You can select what sort of
browser support you want.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.970
So you can be
really harsh and be

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.959
like, if there's an old browser
that requires xyz to work,

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.019
you can just basically
say, sorry, I'm

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.330
not going to support
that for security reasons

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.770
or whatever else.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.630
And it literally just
gives you the config file,

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.665
everything just set up.

00:04:27.665 --> 00:04:28.540
ADDY: That's awesome.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.040
MATT: So I'm looking at it,
and already the SSL protocols

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.980
doesn't include
SSL3, which is why

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.340
I'm now susceptible to POODLE.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.190
So all I have to do is
literally copy this back over,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.060
and I'm good to go.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.670
Then, very recently,
the past week or so,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.682
someone introduced me to
httpsecurityreport.com.

00:04:45.682 --> 00:04:48.010
ADDY:
httpsecurityreport.com, OK.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.900
What does it do?

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.607
MATT: So, it literally is
very similar to SSL labs.

00:04:51.607 --> 00:04:53.190
It's kind of nice
because it gives you

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.230
an even higher level
of overview of where

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.257
you're doing well on your site.

00:04:57.257 --> 00:04:59.090
But this looks at
slightly different things.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.950
Like, I've never considered
the content security policy

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.055
of my site, which
is things like,

00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:05.930
if you're pulling in a
third-party resources,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.720
like Google Fonts,
you can basically say,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.850
if I have a CSP policy which
excludes that, it won't load,

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.240
even though I called
it in on my web page.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.760
So with your
mixed-content thing,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.500
you could sit there and say,
CSP is just addyosmani.com.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.610
That would all
just get shut down.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.300
Which is not what you want,
but it's an interesting point

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.050
that I've never even
considered as a thing

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.890
until I used this tool.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.680
ADDY: This tool is neat.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.810
The current default
non-HTTPS version of my site

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.350
is getting a very,
very respectable 17 out

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.570
of 100 at the moment.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.790
MATT: That's good.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.270
ADDY: It's great.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.900
MATT: I'm guessing 17 out
of 100, rather than 20,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.320
just saying.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.680
ADDY: Let's go with that.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.080
And the HTTPS version
is getting a solid 51.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.000
MATT: Nice.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.460
That's not too bad.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.980
I'm only on 62.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.512
So I've got some work to do.

00:05:58.512 --> 00:05:59.970
But the interesting
thing with this

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.520
is it actually picks up things
like web framework information.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.960
And that's things like,
oh, PHP is actually

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.410
saying this is
the version of PHP

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.140
you support, or you're actually
on version x of engine x.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.580
Which, again, I wouldn't
have ever thought

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.700
of looking into
because in my head,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.140
I wouldn't expect those
tools to be sharing

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.430
that kind of information
by default, let alone

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.520
it be a security issue anyway.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.622
But those three things, I
found immensely helpful.

00:06:26.622 --> 00:06:28.580
I'm using them basically
to guide where I spend

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.220
all my time and effort on work.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.560
ADDY: Sounds good.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.010
