00:00:07.787 --> 00:00:09.370
MATT GAUNT: So in
this mini tip, we're

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.960
going to be looking
Service Worker Toolbox.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.880
I'm Matt Gaunt.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.174
I've got Addy
Osmani with me, so--

00:00:15.174 --> 00:00:16.590
ADDY OSMANI: Addy
Osmani, Esquire.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.760
MATT GAUNT: Be
awesome to each other.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.540
So yes.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.150
Service Worker
Toolbox is a library

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.867
that basically helps you with
building out a service worker.

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:30.450
ADDY OSMANI: Is
Service Worker Toolbox

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.512
useful for, like, runtime stuff?

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:34.220
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.011
It's largely for runtime
stuff, but it also

00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:38.960
does some precaching
and other bits.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.284
Generally, it's like any
boilerplate stuff that you

00:00:41.284 --> 00:00:43.700
would always have to write and
some of the best practices,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.340
this just breaks into, like,
much easier, cleaner APIs.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.192
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:00:48.192 --> 00:00:49.900
MATT GAUNT: So that's
the end goal of it.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.200
And the entire goal of this
mini tip is just to show you

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.705
how to get it set up to use it.

00:00:54.705 --> 00:00:56.080
And all we're
going to do is just

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.940
cache one web page that will
basically serve offline.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.620
So steps are going to be
register a service worker.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.480
We then need to grab SW Toolbox.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.174
We're then going to
precache our page.

00:01:08.174 --> 00:01:10.590
And then we're going to serve
that page up from the cache.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.770
ADDY OSMANI: That sounds legit.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.400
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.680
Addy pointed out
that I didn't need

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.180
to put numbers next to an
editor with line numbers, but.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.570
ADDY OSMANI: Some people
would call it redundant,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.947
but I'm not going to say that.

00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:20.780
MATT GAUNT: So the first
step is going to be

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.260
we need to actually check
whether Service Worker is

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.340
supported, which we can
do with that if check,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.140
if service worker navigator.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.356
And if it is, we need to
register a service worker.

00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:32.480
So we're going to register.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.550
And I'm going to
create a random file,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.910
and I'm going to call it
sw.js and put it at the root.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.910
Putting it at the root
is quite important

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.759
because it means it can control
any part of your web page.

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.050
And that will return a promise.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.350
So we've got then and catch.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.590
Then we'll basically
do the callback

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.301
if the registration
was sucessful.

00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:52.800
Catch will be if there was any
errors or anything like that.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.466
ADDY OSMANI: OK.

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:54.755
So using promises here.

00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:58.020
There's an article by Jake
on this stuff from, like,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.376
last year or the year before.

00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:01.000
MATT GAUNT: Super
good, super thorough.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Probably has a couple of poop
jokes in there because Jake.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.700
But yeah.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.450
We'll link to that in
the YouTube comments

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.770
because if you're
new to promises,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.530
definitely worth checking out.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.540
So I'm adding some
logging because, you know,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.100
I need to check whether
it actually works or not.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.930
I did add in some stupid
errors when I first tried this.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.590
So yeah.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.311
It's done, boom.

00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:21.560
No service workers registered.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.150
And the reason for
that is that sw.js file

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.760
doesn't actually exist.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.560
So got to make it.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.900
As you can tell, I'm
really efficient at typing.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.650
And because a service worker
is just normal JavaScript,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.700
we can just dump in,
like a console log,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.190
to make sure it's working.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.566
And Chrome Dev Tools will
show us that message.

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:40.400
ADDY OSMANI: Yay.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.340
MATT GAUNT: Hello
from service worker.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.810
And yay, it registered.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.277
So that's all good.

00:02:44.277 --> 00:02:46.110
So first step, registering
a service worker.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.750
We've covered that.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.196
Next step is to
add in SW Toolbox.

00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:53.070
Before we can add it
in, we've got to get it.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.080
So you can get it
from NPM or Bower.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.970
I prefer NPM for all the things.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.000
So go grab that.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.190
And the GitHub page has an
example of what you need to do,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.440
which is Import Scripts.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.074
And what Import Scripts
does is basically,

00:03:09.074 --> 00:03:11.240
for a service worker, it
will go and grab that file,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.370
but it will also cache
that file for you

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.200
and make sure it all works.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.370
So you can always
rely on that being--

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.430
if there's any problems
with it being pulled down

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.550
or anything, Service
Worker won't install.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.740
So that's all nice and handy.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.840
So we Import Scripts.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.030
And it's all funky.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.440
I'm going to ignore that bit
because, you know, reasons.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.023
And once we import
it, we can actually

00:03:32.023 --> 00:03:33.850
use it by just Toolbox.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.460
So we add it to the Service
Worker's global scope.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.030
And we can do
toolbox.options.debug

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.520
equals true.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.750
Now, this is really handy when
you first start out using this

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.020
and if you run into
any problems with it,

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.500
but it does get pretty
spammy pretty quick.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.372
So if I refresh, there you go.

00:03:50.372 --> 00:03:51.830
Service Worker
Toolbox now printing

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.624
out a load of different logs.

00:03:53.624 --> 00:03:56.040
As you start using this more,
this will get full of stuff.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.390
But for now, it's really useful.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.730
We know it's working.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.420
So the next step is going to
be we need to actually precache

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.820
our home page.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.810
So what that means is when the
Service Worker's installed,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.330
it will go and grab
index page and save it.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.530
So precache is a method.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.037
It takes an array of strings.

00:04:13.037 --> 00:04:14.620
And it will cache
whatever's in there.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.360
ADDY OSMANI: So that's an
array of different filenames

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.490
that you want to
precache, right?

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.156
MATT GAUNT: Yes.

00:04:18.156 --> 00:04:20.870
So you could do CSS, JavaScript
files, anything you want.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.360
So just doing that, we
can go refresh the page.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.818
And then Toolbox
will be like, hey,

00:04:24.818 --> 00:04:27.130
I've got some precached
stuff, precache list slash.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.880
ADDY OSMANI: Nice.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.920
So this stuff gets precached
into the Service Worker Cache

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.420
API?

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.930
MATT GAUNT: Yes.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.420
ADDY OSMANI: Sweet.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.420
MATT GAUNT: So it's
different to the HTTP cache.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.980
This is the cash
that you control

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.100
and Service Worker or
the actual web page

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.622
can view what's inside it.

00:04:39.622 --> 00:04:41.080
But that won't
actually do anything

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.260
right now because we need
to actually tell the service

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.840
worker that when you see this
/ request, return something.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.180
And what that return
is you can control.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.880
So here we're saying, for a
get request on the rooter,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.730
and when it's a / get request,
I want you to use the caching

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.754
mechanism toolbox.fastest.

00:05:00.754 --> 00:05:01.420
ADDY OSMANI: OK.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.280
So it's got toolbox.fastest.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.157
What are the other
options that it supports

00:05:05.157 --> 00:05:06.115
and how do they differ?

00:05:06.115 --> 00:05:08.247
MATT GAUNT: There's
cache only, network only.

00:05:08.247 --> 00:05:09.580
They're fairly self-explanatory.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.454
But toolbox.fastest I've
used in this example

00:05:11.454 --> 00:05:14.670
because what it does is it
makes one check in the cache

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.564
and then it does one
request to the network.

00:05:16.564 --> 00:05:17.230
ADDY OSMANI: Oh.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.470
MATT GAUNT: And whichever one
is the fastest to respond wins.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.230
So normally, it's
always the cache.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.950
But the nice thing is once
the network request comes in,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.870
it will update the cache.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.320
And it will be clear why that's
important in a short while

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.194
because I'm going to show you
a demo of why it's useful.

00:05:33.194 --> 00:05:34.550
ADDY OSMANI: Sweet.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.980
MATT GAUNT: So I'm doing
some Control-Shift refreshes

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.370
because I need to force a
refresh of the Service Worker,

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.427
and the Shift basically
makes it happen.

00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:43.760
So we've got some extra logging.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.370
You can see like strategy
cache being printed now.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.440
And that's because it's
actually serving up

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.130
the web page from the cache.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.769
Awesome.

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:52.310
To make sure it's
definitely working,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.700
you can go to Network
Panel, click on Offline.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.020
Do another refresh.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.770
And you'll notice that
the page is working

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.990
even though we're offline.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.730
Awesome.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.180
The font has changed because
Google Fonts is being used

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.930
and it can't actually
pull them down.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.165
ADDY OSMANI: So you
can also set up Toolbox

00:06:07.165 --> 00:06:09.540
to offline your Google Font
stuff as well if you want to.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.415
MATT GAUNT: You most
certainly can because it

00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:12.320
supports [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.279
So if I now change the HTML
page and refresh the page,

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:16.820
because we're offline,
it's not going

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.830
to change because there's
nothing it can do.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.789
If I change the no
throttling and refresh,

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.330
it's gone back with the fonts,
but it's still the same thing.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.650
If I refresh again, this
time, because of the fastest,

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.344
it's updated the
cache from the network

00:06:29.344 --> 00:06:30.510
and now we got a new change.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.885
ADDY OSMANI: That's
kind of nice.

00:06:31.885 --> 00:06:34.620
MATT GAUNT: So toolbox.fastest
is like a really safe option

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.120
because it means as you're going
along, you'll cache things,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.029
but you'll also update them
over time, which is really nice.

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:43.320
The problem is it's quite
wasteful because it basically

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.510
means you're not really doing
anything other than having

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.377
a cache as you're
going along, which

00:06:48.377 --> 00:06:49.460
you can make a lot better.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.180
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.096
MATT GAUNT: So there's
a couple of mechanisms,

00:06:52.096 --> 00:06:54.990
and it's too much for me to
cover in this mini tip, but--

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.560
ADDY OSMANI: This is your
way of saying you're lazy.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.210
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.459
I'm saying that right now,
we need to find some better

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:00.400
options for it.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.939
It will all be good.

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:03.730
But generally, there's
a couple of options.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.300
You can use things like,
if it's a static site,

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.672
maybe build date or a
build version of some sort.

00:07:09.672 --> 00:07:11.880
If there's a way with things
like CSS and JavaScript,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.810
if you're using
file revisioning,

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.120
that's really handy
because you can precache.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.890
Just say only use
the cache because I

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.340
know it's going to be there.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.194
And basically, once the
file revision updates,

00:07:22.194 --> 00:07:23.360
your Service Worker updates.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.901
And then basically, everything
will just train on from there.

00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:28.610
The browser will update
your Service Worker.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.110
Yeah.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.815
And then there's
also SW Precache

00:07:30.815 --> 00:07:34.410
as well, which does loads
of crazy stuff with your

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.980
build process and
basically gives you

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.090
a really efficient
way of doing things.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.070
ADDY OSMANI: And it
generates you a Service

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.560
Worker with everything set up.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.268
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:07:41.268 --> 00:07:43.530
But it's a bit more
of an all or nothing.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.010
It's a bit more configured
at the initial set up.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.580
But it does result in something
really solid at the end.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.450
So you've got two options.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.310
SW Toolbox is great
if you're first

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.820
tinkering with Service
Worker tool, service workers

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.230
in general, it's really nice.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.980
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.280
So people should probably go
check out the Service Worker

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.850
Toolbox and SW Precache build
tools and libraries over

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.939
on Web Fundamentals.

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:09.605
MATT GAUNT: Yes.

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:10.634
ADDY OSMANI: Yes, maybe.

00:08:10.634 --> 00:08:11.300
MATT GAUNT: Yes.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.130
Or GitHub.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:12.410
ADDY OSMANI: Or GitHub.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:12.760
MATT GAUNT: I don't mind.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.460
Either.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:13.970
They're both up there.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.261
ADDY OSMANI: They're both good.

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:17.800
