[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:11.890
ADDY: So Matt, what's
in your bundle?

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.207
MATT: I don't have any bundles.

00:00:13.207 --> 00:00:15.040
ADDY: You don't have
any JavaScript bundles?

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.970
MATT: I don't write
JavaScript anymore.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.032
ADDY: Has JavaScript
fatigue finally gotten you?

00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:20.990
MATT: Yeah, I'll say--
I'm just-- I'm dead now.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.323
ADDY: What do you do these days?

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:24.120
MATT: I come and meet
you in a coffee shop,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.610
and get free coffee, because
I'm a delightful human being.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.040
ADDY: Like any normal developer.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.860
I see.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.600
OK, so for everybody else out
there working on Java scripts,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.600
there's a really cool
tool I recently discovered

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.015
called Source Map Explorer.

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.080
You can get it on npm.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.747
This is sort of useful
for understanding

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.705
what is in your JavaScript
bundle, which you're

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:41.885
shipping down to your users.

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:45.300
MATT: So how is this different
from just normal source maps?

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.871
What does it give you?

00:00:47.307 --> 00:00:49.140
ADDY: It sort of
understands your dependency

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.530
graph and dependency tree.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.270
Will visualize it for you
in a nice, pleasant way.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.770
MATT: OK.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.820
ADDY: OK, so I'm going to run
it against a source map that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.140
was generated from one
of my vendor bundles,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.790
and just show you
what this looks like.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.910
So here we've got Chrome open.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.690
I've got the Source Map
Explorer dependency graph

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.775
sort of visualized here.

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:09.900
And this is kind of nice,
because I can take a look

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.975
at any one part of my graph.

00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:13.350
So I can see here--
all these are

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.190
all of the different bits and
pieces of React that I'm using.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.285
I've got React router
over here in the corner.

00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:19.660
And I can zoom in and out.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.720
It's so nice and pretty.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.290
But I've also got-- I can see
what percentage of my bundle

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.100
is being taken up by
different libraries.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.540
Here I can see
that, in this case,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.790
Firebase is taking up
quite a lot of my bundle.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.360
But I wanted to
show you a pro tip

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.490
that I was walking through with
David East the other day, so--

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.490
and Source Map Explorer
visualizes this quite nicely.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.330
So I can actually just require
in the pieces of Firebase

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.297
that I'm actually using, so--

00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:46.380
MATT: Rather than a whole
massive bundle of thing.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.796
ADDY: Rather than
the whole thing.

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:50.600
So, few minor changes.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.000
I can go and do a new build.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.370
And if that all works out, I can
show you the before and after,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.220
thanks to some movie magic.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.730
Now we're going to go and run it
against the new vendor bundle.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.710
And what we can
see now, is that A,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.470
we've got a much smaller
bundle on the whole.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.750
But B, we've also changed
the look of this graph.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.370
So earlier we had Firebase, it's
about 304 kilobytes, sort of.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.050
That's unminified, ungzipped,
or anything like that.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.950
But it contained database,
authentication, storage,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.680
an app.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.230
I really only need
app and database.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.470
So I just switched my
code over to using those.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.146
Atomic modules--
and here you can

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:31.770
see that we've actually
managed to make

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.895
our app a tiny bit smaller.

00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:33.490
MATT: Yay!

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.900
ADDY: It's 138
kilobytes, before we've

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.290
minified it and gzipped it.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.814
MATT: All you need to use this
is to just the source map.

00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:43.230
You don't need the original
source, or anything like that?

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.640
ADDY: It just works
on source maps.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.970
So, normally--

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.360
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.970
ADDY: --like for dev, at least,
I usually have my source maps

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.060
on my JavaScript files.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.310
MATT: Yeah, it's kind of nice.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.260
Because I guess, if
you strip stuff out,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.350
the actual main source, by
whatever tooling that then gets

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.701
accounted for in the source
map-- yeah, it's nice.

00:02:58.057 --> 00:03:00.390
ADDY: There's a bunch of
different bundle analysis tools

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.570
are available.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.360
Web Pack Bundle
Analyzer is another one.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.155
That's got
colorization in place.

00:03:05.155 --> 00:03:06.030
And it's super sweet.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.904
Specific to Web Pack,
I think, at the moment.

00:03:07.904 --> 00:03:09.804
But it's also
worth checking out.

00:03:09.804 --> 00:03:11.220
But yeah, tools
like this are just

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.595
great for understanding exactly
what you're shipping down

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:14.310
to your users.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.331
So it's good to ask yourself,
what's in your bundle?

00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:18.820
MATT: I see what you did there.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.370
Nice.
