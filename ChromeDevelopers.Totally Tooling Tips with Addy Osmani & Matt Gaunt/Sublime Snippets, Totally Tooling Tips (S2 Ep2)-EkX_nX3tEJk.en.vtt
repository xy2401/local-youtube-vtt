00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.687
ADDY OSMANI: Do
you use snippets?

00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:20.270
MATT GAUNT: No, when
you say snippets,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.300
I think of little
chunks of code I

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.687
get from a [? GIS ?]
or something like that.

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:25.770
ADDY OSMANI: Pretty close.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.290
You don't use snippets
in, like, Sublime text?

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.390
MATT GAUNT: No, I'm looking at
Atom right now and I have them.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.700
I don't know what they are.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.410
ADDY OSMANI: I'm
deducting a point

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.020
from my Yelp review of you.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.700
MATT GAUNT: How can
I have a Yelp score?

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.480
I'm not a place.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.354
ADDY OSMANI: You have--
people can visit you.

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:47.450
You're totally a place.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.555
MATT GAUNT: I feel like
there's going to be one review,

00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:49.670
and it's just you.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.995
It's going to be anonymous.

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:55.270
It's just like,
worst person ever.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.515
ADDY OSMANI: These are
your words, not mine.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.765
MATT GAUNT: What are snippets?

00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:00.223
ADDY OSMANI: Snippets
are basically

00:01:00.223 --> 00:01:02.010
reusable chunks of
code that you use

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.810
in your daily workflow, stuff
that you find yourself writing

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.710
out a lot that would
probably benefit

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.070
from automating a tiny bit.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.370
MATT GAUNT: Yes, so
things like ES6 classes,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.240
where you've got to have
the class keyword, name

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.101
of the thing, brackets, curly
brackets, whatever, and then

00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:19.100
that's just boilerplate.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.350
That's always going
to be the case.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.490
So you could just
have a snippet,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.920
add that in, and
then what you've got

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.820
to do is change the class name.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.410
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah,
and it's kind of neat,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.120
because you can create
your own snippets.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.370
You can go and customize them.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.070
There's whole
packages of snippets,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.940
depending on the
libraries you are using.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.100
MATT GAUNT: Oh, so you can just
import someone else's snippets.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.170
ADDY OSMANI: So,
it's kind of neat.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.700
There's a bunch
of snippets that I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.390
find myself using pretty often.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.100
The first set, are the
JavaScript and Node snippets

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.487
from Zeno Rocha.

00:01:45.487 --> 00:01:47.070
And this is kind of
a really neat step

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.410
because it covers everything
from little expansions,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.370
for adding that listeners
to your DOM nodes,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.330
creating elements,
creating fragments.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.380
If you're working
on prototypes, it'll

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.170
give you a nice little
expansion for that.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.670
And it will also highlight
the relevant piece of code

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.545
that you're probably
going to want to change,

00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:05.370
like the name of the object.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.330
MATT GAUNT: The name of
the class, the prototype,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.970
and the function.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.530
Nice.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.030
ADDY OSMANI: Which
is kind of useful

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.000
and also it does other things
like scaffolding out your IIFE,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.341
or "iffies".

00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:15.216
MATT GAUNT: "Iffies"?

00:02:15.216 --> 00:02:15.710
ADDY OSMANI: "Iffies."

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.220
MATT GAUNT: What are "iffies"?

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.330
ADDY OSMANI: They
are Immediately

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.900
Invoked Functional Expressions.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.044
MATT GAUNT: You're
raising more questions

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:24.960
than you're answering.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.860
You're just saying words.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.860
ADDY OSMANI: Just words?

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.270
There's a blog post by Ben
Alman you can go check out.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.890
It covers all this stuff.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.360
It has a great Yelp review.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.300
That's all I'm saying.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.174
MATT GAUNT: From you.

00:02:37.174 --> 00:02:38.716
ADDY OSMANI: From me.

00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:41.680
MATT GAUNT: What other
snippet packages do you have?

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.990
ADDY OSMANI: So, you've been
using ES6 a bunch lately,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.490
right?

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.870
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.260
ADDY OSMANI: What
do you like in ES6?

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.190
What are you using?

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.050
MATT GAUNT: It's mostly classes.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.932
I've started getting into
[INAUDIBLE] functions,

00:02:52.932 --> 00:02:54.890
and Promises I've been
using for a little while

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.820
just because the service
workers [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.800
Stuff like that.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.883
Those are the main things.

00:02:58.883 --> 00:03:01.190
ADDY OSMANI: OK, so there
is a really decent package

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.767
called ES6 Toolkit that includes
snippets for Promises, classes.

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:10.100
For classes it's really neat,
because it will give you--

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.975
again it will highlight,
it will scaffold out

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:13.440
the whole class
with a constructor,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.356
and it will also highlight
the section of code

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:18.840
that you probably want to change
first, which is kind of nice.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.020
It also does fat arrows,
generators, beatmaps, sets.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.020
MATT GAUNT: So those
things are not played with.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.436
It sounds like
this might actually

00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:29.796
be a nice way of learning
about the new ES6 features.

00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:30.920
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah think so.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.750
I think they've
also got-- have you

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.330
used the object literal
shorthands in ES6?

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.200
So the basic idea
there is that you don't

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.690
have to type out as much code.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.900
We would use the book
for functions and things.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.535
It also supports that
and modules, too.

00:03:44.535 --> 00:03:45.800
It's kind of neat.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.030
There's ES6 Toolkit.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.550
Another set that I find
myself using pretty often

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.644
is the Polymer and Web Component
snippet package by Rob Dodson.

00:03:55.644 --> 00:03:57.060
That's useful
because it helps you

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.530
when you're writing
not just apps

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.931
but also your own elements.

00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:03.180
So let's say you're creating
a demo page for your app.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.950
It's got an expansion
that will write out

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.650
all of the boilerplate
code for your metatags.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.504
It will include the web
component polyfills.

00:04:09.504 --> 00:04:10.920
And then you can
just go and start

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.410
creating your own elements.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.310
And when you're
doing that, there's

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.851
a few things you
always end up doing,

00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:16.459
like writing HTML imports.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.779
And Rob Dodson's written
this little shorthand HI.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.060
That's like saying HI,
do me the entire line

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.250
that I require for
writing an import,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.720
or write me out all of
the boilerplate code

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.980
I need for my element.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.490
MATT GAUNT: And most of it
there is the one criticism

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.530
I have of Polymer.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.880
I like the notions of being able
to pull in some component just

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.050
using my page.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.580
It's all the stuff around it.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.080
You have to add to
your [? bower, ?]

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.980
you have to add it to the
actual HTML of your page,

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.450
and you've got to add
in the HTML import.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.290
And it's just like those steps
are a point where I'm like,

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.320
I just want this thing to exist,
can you just make magic happen?

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.770
So anything that simplifies
that, I think is really nice.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.639
ADDY OSMANI: If only you had
a friend slash colleague that

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.430
wrote something, a
Polymer starter kit that

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.910
can potentially help you there.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.434
MATT GAUNT: I see
what you've done.

00:05:07.434 --> 00:05:09.350
ADDY OSMANI: For people
using other libraries,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.790
and there's a ton of
other libraries out there,

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.800
there's things like
Frameworks, like Ember,

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.730
things like Angular,
Angular 2, and so on, React.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.502
Yeah, there's actually a
really good set of packages

00:05:18.502 --> 00:05:20.210
that you can check
out for those as well.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.970
The React one is, I
think, pretty popular.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.290
It works well with
Babel, so check them out.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.790
MATT GAUNT: So the
next time there's

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.565
a new hot framework
on the side, there

00:05:29.565 --> 00:05:33.170
will just be a brand new package
for snippets and then, boom!

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.070
ADDY OSMANI: Yes?

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.120
