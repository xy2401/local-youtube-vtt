MATT GAUNT: You must have
used Dreamweaver, right?

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.601
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah,
I use Dreamweaver,

00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:18.710
but I used other tools
before Dreamweaver.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.250
I used Notepad.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.210
MATT GAUNT: Notepad's
not really a tool, is it?

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.876
ADDY OSMANI: What are
you talking about?

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:26.510
Notepad was the pinnacle
tool of its time.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.300
MATT GAUNT: How is
it a pinnacle tool?

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.310
It was text.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.810
That was it.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.851
ADDY OSMANI: It was text.

00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:31.860
That's all you needed.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.509
MATT GAUNT: But it's not a tool.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.810
It's just like, nah.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.726
ADDY OSMANI: Notepad
didn't you let you change

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:37.370
the font face until Windows 98.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.550
MATT GAUNT: And that was a
beautiful day for you, I'd say.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.080
ADDY OSMANI: It was a
beautiful day for me.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.500
It's like we got
one new feature.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.462
That's a party.

00:00:43.462 --> 00:00:45.670
MATT GAUNT: That was the
one feature everyone wanted.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.850
Everything else, nah.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.190
Like I used to use--
Dreamweaver was the first one

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.650
I think I used.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.230
No, actually, it was Frontpage.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.480
Frontpage was beautiful.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.438
ADDY OSMANI: Frontpage?

00:00:54.438 --> 00:00:56.512
Was this Frontpage 2.0?

00:00:56.512 --> 00:00:58.220
MATT GAUNT: I can't
remember the version.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.340
It was old school, though,
and I enjoyed it greatly.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.715
I had like a
fluorescent mushroom

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:03.140
as my tiled background.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.820
It was great.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.540
ADDY OSMANI:
Frontpage was great.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.150
You could easily add in your
marquee tags and your blink

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.235
tags.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:11.890
MATT GAUNT: Dancing babies,
accounts, under constructions.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.640
ADDY OSMANI: Fire.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.930
Just random fire
anywhere on your page.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.040
MATT GAUNT: So I use
Packaging Control just

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.540
for when I'm installing things.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.500
Like I've had to install
it at some point.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.657
But what do you--

00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:23.740
ADDY OSMANI: So I usually
use-- so Package Control

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.400
is a lot like Tinder for
Sublime Text modules.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.610
You swipe left or right
depending on the quality

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.169
of plug-in you're after.

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:34.210
MATT GAUNT: So which ones
do you swipe right for?

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.880
ADDY OSMANI: Swipe
right is good.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.450
MATT GAUNT: Right is good.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.760
The one that you want to keep.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.040
Yes.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.540
ADDY OSMANI: I'm
terrible at Tinder.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.855
So I swipe right for linters.

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:42.480
I love linters.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.090
Linters help make sure
that your code quality is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.180
where you want it at.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.910
MATT GAUNT: I use
Linters as well.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.680
I've been using [? JSON ?]
for a little while.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.770
And it's actually
been insanely good.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.944
So if you do things
like foo.helloword,

00:01:57.944 --> 00:01:59.860
and you haven't actually
defined foo anywhere,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.859
that doesn't make sense.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.170
You can't call a function
helloworld on nothing.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.320
So for things like that,
it's super helpful.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.340
And I used to have
[? JSON ?] in and my

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.880
build process, which
is fine, but it would

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.230
complain in the background.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.265
And it's so much easier just
having it in my text editor

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:14.890
there and then.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.990
And it just catches tons
of little errors like that.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.156
ADDY OSMANI: That's awesome.

00:02:18.156 --> 00:02:19.640
So you can easily
visualize where

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.130
you're breaking your code,
and you can go in and fix it.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.400
That's pretty cool.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.290
So on a similar to that, I
love using a tool called JSCS

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.250
for making sure that you're
following your JavaScript style

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.120
guide.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.810
And here I've got JSCS running
against a piece of code.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.060
And it's highlighting
anywhere where I'm

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.530
going away from my style guide.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.100
I've got operators that are
sticking to variables that they

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.790
shouldn't be.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.530
I've got spaces in front
of opening brackets.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.800
One of the really
cool things about JSCS

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.710
is they recently
added this option that

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.730
lets you go and format your code
so it fixes all of the style

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.620
guide issues for you.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.880
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.995
You don't even have
to do anything.

00:02:56.995 --> 00:02:57.300
ADDY OSMANI: It's amazing.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.230
Exactly.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.185
MATT GAUNT: So does it have like
a [? JSON ?] RCFile as well?

00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:02.060
ADDY OSMANI: It does.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.560
It does.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.001
So similar to the way [? JSON ?]
has got [? a JSON ?] RCFile,

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:06.500
right?

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.820
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.778
ADDY OSMANI: So this is
a very similar concept.

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:11.250
You can set a preset
that you want to use.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.217
So JSCS supports the Google
JavaScript Style Guide.

00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:16.300
And if you want to customize
that a little bit it,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.425
it supports you doing that.

00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:19.883
MATT GAUNT: So anything you
don't like from a default one--

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:20.660
boom.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.200
One of the packages that
I'm finding actually

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.440
more and more useful
is ColorHighlighter.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.650
All it does is it just shows
this like underlined color

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.350
of whatever's in the CSS.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.260
When you hover over it, it
covers the entire background

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.010
with that bit of text with
the color that it represents.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.760
And one of the nice
things that I realized

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.140
is under the package
settings, you

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.500
can actually just
switch it out so you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.100
can stay filled all the time.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.855
And then any color in your
CSS, it will always be filled.

00:03:48.855 --> 00:03:51.380
And it's just really
handy just because you

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.549
can see a color in
your page, quickly see

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.090
where it is in the CSS, and make
any tweaks you want to make.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.300
ADDY OSMANI: Right.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.610
So normally people end
up using external tools

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.610
to go and select colors.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.484
But this is really useful
because, let's say,

00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:02.950
you're messing
around your styles,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.340
and you just want
to change the color.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.200
Just bring up color
picker inside Sublime,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.922
change the color, hit pick, and
it'll go and update the value.

00:04:09.922 --> 00:04:11.880
MATT GAUNT: This actually
swaps it in the file.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.210
Nice.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.168
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah, it'll
swap it right in line.

00:04:14.168 --> 00:04:16.214
And if you happen to be
using a getter plug-in,

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.880
it'll also highlight
that with the color

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.180
that you've just chosen.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.779
So it's nice and visual.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:21.269
MATT GAUNT: So I
mean, it kind of

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.852
does what ColorHighlighter does,
but in a lesser form and more

00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:25.220
rubbish.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.420
Yeah, sure, OK.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.334
ADDY OSMANI: For a
given definition.

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.750
MATT GAUNT: The
only other plug-in

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.790
that I use on a regular
basis is AutoFileName.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.680
And all it does is, whenever
you're typing in a file,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.020
whether it be adding it in HTML
like referencing a CSS file

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.190
or adding an image as
a background image,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.130
as you're typing, it just
says, this is probably the file

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.880
that you're going to
type in, whether it's

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.100
a folder or a file name.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.750
And it just autofills
it, basically.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.920
ADDY OSMANI: You may just
be the laziest human being

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.040
I've ever met.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.180
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.550
All it's doing is just stopping
me from adding in typos.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.925
ADDY OSMANI: OK,
so it avoids you

00:04:57.925 --> 00:05:00.440
having to go through the file
tree and look for the file

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.600
that you're working on.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.130
MATT GAUNT: Exactly.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.450
ADDY OSMANI: Do you
use Autoprefixer?

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.158
MATT GAUNT: I use it
in my build process.

00:05:05.158 --> 00:05:08.450
ADDY OSMANI: OK, so you can
also use it in your editor.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.310
Just work on some styles
without any prefixes,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.050
go and enable a plugin, it'll
fill out everything for you.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.530
MATT GAUNT: But like why
have it in your text edits?

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.320
Because the build
process makes sense.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.500
You type your CSS.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.560
You do all the things.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.399
Build process picks it all
out, creates the final output,

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:26.940
and then it keeps
the CSS just clean.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.820
It doesn't have any of the
stuff that you normally have.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.740
ADDY OSMANI: I
guess this is useful

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.135
if you're working on
a smaller prototype

00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:32.746
and you want the
same benefits as you

00:05:32.746 --> 00:05:33.560
get in the build process.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.440
MATT GAUNT: So basically,
when you're too

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.910
lazy to add in a build process.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.785
ADDY OSMANI: Exactly.

00:05:36.785 --> 00:05:37.480
Yes.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.258
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:05:38.258 --> 00:05:41.848
