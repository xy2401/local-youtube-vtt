00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.730
MATT: So what OS do you use?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.087
ADDY: The default one.

00:00:17.087 --> 00:00:19.170
MATT: So what if you buy
a computer without an OS?

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.669
That's it?

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:20.310
Just default?

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.020
ADDY: It's just default.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.790
MATT: You don't care?

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.250
You just stare at
a blank screen.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.000
ADDY: Do not care.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.650
No, I love using Macs.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.541
I love using OS X.

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:27.040
MATT: OK.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.420
So that's what you're
using at home as well?

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.720
ADDY: Yeah.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.886
It's what I'm using at home.

00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:33.410
If I'm testing, I'll probably
use Windows 10 or Linux

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.410
in an NVM.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.220
MATT: OK.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.190
So I use OS X at work,
largely because if I ever

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.036
go somewhere to a
conference and just

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:43.161
plug it into a projector,
that's normally the point

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:46.190
that Linux would decide,
heh, heh, lull, fail.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.230
But at home, I use
Linux, and I love it.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.370
And the thing that
I've realized is

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.885
that each OS that
I play with tends

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.260
to have nice features that
the other one doesn't, and I'm

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.520
sort of like polyfilling
features with just apps.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.960
In your bag of tricks, what are
your main tools that you use?

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.810
ADDY: I rely pretty
heavily on a tool called

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.919
Browsersync at the moment.

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:06.460
MATT: Oh, OK.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.030
ADDY: So doing a lot of
cross-device development,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.950
trying to build web
apps that work really

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.217
well on mobile and
tablet on a desktop.

00:01:13.217 --> 00:01:14.800
And something that's
useful in my flow

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.095
is like whenever I make an
edit to my app or my site,

00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:19.314
just having it live
reload across all

00:01:19.314 --> 00:01:20.230
the different devices.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.990
MATT: Yep.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.820
ADDY: So Browsersync
let's you do that.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.820
Now, in their latest
version, they've

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.725
actually added an entire UI
on top of that feature, which

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:28.430
is kind of neat.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.930
MATT: Nice.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.720
ADDY: So you can, in addition
to-- so Browsersync's

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.500
always let you do
interaction sync, which

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.540
means that you can
synchronize clicks,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.776
scrolls, filling in forms.

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:40.400
MATT: Yeah, just
anything you do on one

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.640
gets replicated across
the whole board.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.490
ADDY: Exactly.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.179
But with their UI, you can
now get granular control

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.970
over each of those.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.480
So you can say, well, I just
want to synchronize clicks,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.030
or I just want to
synchronize scroll.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.530
MATT: Yeah.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.760
You can switch
everything else off.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.055
ADDY: Yeah.

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:52.350
MATT: Nice.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.808
ADDY: And another
new thing they've

00:01:53.808 --> 00:01:56.631
added-- so you've used network
throttling in dev tools, right?

00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:57.130
MATT: Yeah.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.440
ADDY: So Browsersync also
supports network throttling.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.800
Lots of presets included,
very useful for just

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.430
seeing how your sites perform
on a slightly slower connection.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.929
MATT: Nice.

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.820
So basically, where
in dev tools you just

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.817
have a whole-- like
you'd have to do it

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:11.400
for each individual
device, this one's

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.450
just your just like
blanket this is the speed.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.330
ADDY: Exactly, exactly.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.930
Useful for seeing what it's like
to try out a site on a train

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.410
where the connection's
super slow.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.954
MATT: It doesn't support
offline, though, does it?

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:25.620
ADDY: That sounds
like a feature request

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.300
you should be putting in.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.925
MATT: There's no
underground simulation

00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:30.227
to prove that
Service Worker works.

00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:31.060
So think about that.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.340
ADDY: Be the feature request you
want to see in the world, Matt.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.284
MATT: You know I
hate that saying.

00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:41.229
So one of the other tools
that I've actually-- I

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:43.270
can't live without any
more is a Chrome extension

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.930
called WhatFont.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.790
And literally all it
does is you click it,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.600
it goes into this weird
mode where the mouse ends up

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.360
with a little
field which is just

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.915
the current font that's being
used to render a piece of text.

00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:57.164
And I probably only use this
at the start of a project

00:02:57.164 --> 00:02:59.786
where I'm selecting
a font, and I just

00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:02.160
need to make sure that the
URL is actually the right one.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.390
Because normally I'll
put in a stupid typo,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.355
and then it resets itself,
and I can't actually

00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:08.410
tell what the current
font is on the page.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.407
This one does that.

00:03:09.407 --> 00:03:11.490
Long font family, and if
it's like the middle one,

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.420
it would just go,
this is the one

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.900
that's currently being used.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.130
ADDY: Do you use anything
on top of Spotlight?

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.630
MATT: No.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.760
ADDY: For finding things?

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.820
MATT: Like I find
Spotlight is good enough

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.050
for me for everything I
need to do, because normally

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.570
I just open up an
app and I'm done.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.200
ADDY: There is so
much more to that.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.570
So a tool that's a little
bit like Viagra for Spotlight

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.264
is Alfred.

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:32.930
MATT: That makes no
sense, but continue.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:33.850
ADDY: Alfred, right?

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.870
So you should be using Alfred.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.450
Alfred is really cool
because it gives you support

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.270
for not just finding
folders and stuff,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.214
but it also gives you support
for hot keys and plug-ins.

00:03:41.214 --> 00:03:43.130
Now, the plug-in side
gets really interesting.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.130
So Zeno Rocha put together
this really cool repo

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.220
called Alfred Workflows,
which includes

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.550
a bunch of the really,
really useful plug-ins

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.430
in that ecosystem.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.850
So, for example,
you can add support

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.797
for searching NPM
directly to Alfred.

00:03:55.797 --> 00:03:57.630
So you can easily find
packages without even

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.490
having to leave that window.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.100
MATT: Nice.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.350
ADDY: You can search for
Grunt plugins, Gulp plugins,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.130
add support for
DASH so you can look

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.290
at documentation while
you're working on your app.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.020
MATT: Nice.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.730
ADDY: You can look for Sublime
plugins, all sorts of stuff.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.390
It's got a lot of
stuff supported.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.480
MATT: I used to have
something similar to that

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.940
for Linux called GNOME Do.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.519
And it was literally like a hot
key, kind of like Spotlight.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.238
It just pops up.

00:04:18.238 --> 00:04:19.529
You can start typing things in.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.737
But then it supported plugins
and all the rest of it.

00:04:21.737 --> 00:04:24.970
And it was really handy, but
I just didn't use it enough.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.130
So I didn't really need to.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.880
ADDY: That's cool.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.780
I mean, there's a
ton of other tools

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.890
that I use in my
day-to-day workflow.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.680
I've tried to document some of
that stuff in some slide decks.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.751
MATT: Coming to another slide
deck near you soon, I'm sure.
