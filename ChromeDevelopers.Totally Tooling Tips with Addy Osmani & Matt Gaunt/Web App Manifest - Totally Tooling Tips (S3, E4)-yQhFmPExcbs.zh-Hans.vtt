00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.026
Matt  我正在为感到孤独的人打造一个网络应用
ADDY OSMANI: So Matt, I'm working on a new web app for lonely people.

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:13.650
不错
MATT GAUNT: OK.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.090
它是干什么的
What does it do?

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.059
它叫什么
What is it called?

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.920
叫做  跟猫聊天
ADDY OSMANI: It's called "Words With Cats." Now-- Words With Cats.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.450
这名字很好
It's a brilliant name.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.760
我希望手机主屏幕上能有个图标
Now, I want to show an icon on my phone's home screen,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.260
如果有人启动它
if someone launches this, and I also

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.680
我希望能像一个图标一样
want to be able to show like an icon or some visual

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.500
或者有启动画面
in a splash screen.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.290
比如一只猫在翻字典之类的
MATT GAUNT: Of a cat reading a dictionary, or something?

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.760
一只猫读  你真是智多星  
ADDY OSMANI: A cat reading-- you're 're a thought leader.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.270
我怎么才能做到
How can I get that done?

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.570
Chrome 现在有添加到主屏幕功能
MATT GAUNT: So Chrome now has the add to home screen stuff.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.780
基本上  你只要满足一些条件
So, basically, if you meet a certain set of criteria

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.962
当用户使用你的网络应用时
when a user is basically engaged in your web app,

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:49.420
会有一条小横幅
it will come a little banner saying, hey, would to add this

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.310
上面写着是否把它添加到主屏幕
to your home screen.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.650
你需要使用 HTTPS
So, you basically need to be on HBS,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.440
service worker  以及 web app manifest
and to have a service worker, and you need a web app manifest.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.904
之后的话
And then after that it's basically,

00:00:57.904 --> 00:01:00.070
只要用户多次使用了
depending on the user coming back a couple of times,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.642
就会出现横幅提示
then it will show the banner.

00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:03.350
你所需要的主要是 web app manifest
So the web app manifest is the main thing

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.000
它能实现这些功能  当然还有其他的
that you need, to enable all of this, along with the other bits.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.240
但是 manifest 现在只是一个 JSON 文件
But the manifest is just a JSON file at that point.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.990
棒
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.360
它只是一个 JSON 文件
So it's just a JSON file.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.810
仅限于 Chrome 平台么
Is this a Chrome-only thing?

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.601
不
MATT GAUNT: No, no.

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:16.160
这是标准通用的
This is all the standard space, so basically any browser

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.340
基本上所有浏览器都能从 link rel 标签中
can look for this link rel tag that links to your manifest

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.390
链接到你的 manifest JSON 文件  解析它
JSON file, at that point they can parse it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.450
你想要实现的那些
and it's just going to-- you have certain things

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.650
浏览器就会展现出来
to find for then browsers to take it all out.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.441
好
ADDY OSMANI: Right.

00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:28.960
所以说 manifest 能让我修改图标
So the manifest lets me customize my icons.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.710
还有其他什么是我能配置的么
What other stuff can I configure in there?

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.930
你可以定义 short name
MATT GAUNT: So, you can define short name, which

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.770
它会显示在你常使用的图标下
would be the text underneath your icon that you'd normally see.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.830
Theme color  Chrome 会在 URL 栏
Theme color, which Chrome uses, is like the URL color

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.580
给 URL 设定颜色
along the URL bar.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.250
Background color  在启动画面中使用
Background color is for the splash screen.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.800
如果你已经添加到主屏幕  点击后
So, if you have that add to home screen, then click on it,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.092
它就会启动  基本上当 Chrome 在加载时
it'll launch and basically while Chrome's loading, what

00:01:49.092 --> 00:01:50.799
你可以展示以单色为底
you can do is show a splash screen that's

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.050
包括带有文字的图标
like a solid color and then have an icon on top of it

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.700
的启动画面
along with the text.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.145
这就是 Background color 的用处
So background color does that.

00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:57.770
比如你有一系列的图标
You've got an array of icons, so again,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.144
它会根据浏览器需要使用图标的场景
depending on what the browser want's to use the icon for,

00:02:00.144 --> 00:02:02.060
选择大小最合适的
it will just pick the best size for it.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.470
Start URL 非常棒 
Start URL is super awesome.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.590
它的用处是
What that is, is basically-- you remember back

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.240
你还记得原来我们在 Chrome 中使用添加到主屏幕么
in the day we used to have add to home screen in Chrome?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.320
它藏在菜单中
It was like hidden in the menu.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.889
恩
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.597
它的作用就是
MATT GAUNT: So, what that would always do

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:14.970
不管你在哪个页面
is whatever page you're on that is where you will get

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.490
当你点击添加到主屏幕时  都会重新指向它
pointed when you click on the icon for the home screen.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.030
Start URL 可以设定它在哪
Start URL let's you define where that is now.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.405
比如有人正在看博客文章
So, if someone was in the middle of a blog article, clicked

00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:26.220
点击添加到主屏幕  现在你就知道了
on add to home screen, now you can say, actually, just

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.220
它会回到博客主页
go to the home of the blog.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.490
你还可以配置 display
Then you've got display.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.680
display 不是以浏览器模式启动
Display is basically rather than launch in browser mode,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.970
它可以全屏显示
you can say actually I want it to go full screen.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:36.980
它就像原生应用一样
ADDY OSMANI: Oh, so you can launch it full

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.750
能够全屏显示  是么
screen the same way that a native app might look like, right?

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.081
就是这样
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:43.395
除此之外  还有 orientations
But, alongside that there is, also, in the spec, orientations.

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:45.940
理论上你可以锁定为纵向或者横向
So you could theoretically lock it to portrait or landscape.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.144
棒  这对游戏很有用
ADDY OSMANI: Oh, cool, so for games that's particularly useful.

00:02:48.144 --> 00:02:52.635
对  当你想只用手柄时
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, if you want to do like forced-- thumb sticks.

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:54.010
关于 start URL
The nice thing, especially, I was

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.630
还有一点特别棒
going to say with the Start URL, you can actually then add

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.550
你可以添加查询参数
the query parameter, so then you can track

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.540
这样你就能追踪到使用人数了
how many people are using it.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.740
啊
ADDY OSMANI: Ah.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.926
比如主屏幕参数为真值
MATT GAUNT: So, like home screen equals true.

00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:03.550
分析结果就会显示给你
And then analytics would just show you.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.300
不错
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.490
基本上就是这些东西了
MATT GAUNT: So that's pretty much the bulk of it.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.240
好的
ADDY OSMANI: Nice.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.390
有没有  比如我想验证 manifest 的合法性
Is there-- if I wanted to like validate

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.160
有没有什么工具可以做到这一点
that I've got a legit manifest, is there are tool I can use for that?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.739
有  有人做了一个 web app manifest 验证器
MATT GAUNT: Yes, someone has built a web app manifest validator.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.447
我觉得 DevTools 也会实现这个功能
I think DevTools were also going to do it

00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:20.625
你可以下载 manifest
so you can like force a download the manifest

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:21.889
让 DevTools 去解析它
and get DevTools to parse it.

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.070
我觉得我们在 Totally Tooling Tears 中也提到过
ADDY OSMANI: I believe we mentioned as much in Totally Tooling Tears.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.401
但我还没亲自用过
MATT GAUNT: But I haven't actually used it yet, myself.

00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:31.650
诚然  如果你不用这类工具
And, admittedly, if you don't use something like that,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.900
就很难知道 manifest 有没有效
it's kind of hard to figure out whether it's working or not.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.180
所以值得去验证一下
So those are well worth checking out.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.138
好吧  所以我们谈到了 web app manifest
ADDY OSMANI: OK, so we talked about the web app

00:03:37.138 --> 00:03:40.130
还有用来验证它的 manifest 验证器
manifest, the manifest validator, for checking out,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.830
DevTools 也在着手这个
DevTools is looking at it.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.840
有没有这方面的文档可以参考呢
Are there docs on this available as well?

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.570
最佳的参考资料就是我们的博客文章
MATT GAUNT: The best thing to look at is [INAUDIBLE] blog post.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.320
它包括示例 manifests  如何把它加到 HTML 页面
It covers example manifests, how do I get it to the HTML page,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.090
还有如何调试它
and then how to debug it as well.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.449
这应该是最好的方法了
So that's probably the best bet.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.240
真棒
ADDY OSMANI: Sweet.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.630
还有它包括在 web starter kit 里
MATT GAUNT: And plus it's in web starter kit,

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.900
以及我们做的很多其他项目中
and a whole other host of the projects that we do.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.280
