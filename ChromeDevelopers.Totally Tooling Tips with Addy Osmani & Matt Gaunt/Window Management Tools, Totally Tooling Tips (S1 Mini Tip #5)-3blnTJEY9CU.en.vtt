00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.830
ADDY: One of the
main things that I

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.410
can't live without any
more on OS X is like Divvy

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.891
And all it does, it just comes
up it is with weird grid thing.

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:19.390
And you can just say, for this
window that I'm currently in,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.620
make it this size and sit
over here on the screen.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.400
And like, on my desktop where
I've got a full keyboard,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.110
I've got a number
pad, and I've got

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.550
like, each portion
of the number pad

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.670
just relates to a
bit of the screen.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.840
And it's just
like, it's so good.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.480
MATT: So Divvy is
pretty awesome.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.926
I've used it in the past.

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:39.047
And if you like a visual
UI for configuring stuff,

00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:39.755
it's pretty cool.

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:42.151
I use an alternative
called Spectacle.

00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:42.650
ADDY: OK.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.440
MATT: It's open source.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.650
But it does something
very similar.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.400
Basically, you can use
keyboard shortcuts,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.890
like say, OK, well, I want
to resize all my windows

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.515
to be on the left or
the right and just

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:51.760
like splice my screen up.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.750
You know, they're
both solid options.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.580
ADDY: Matt, I didn't
know that one existed.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.500
Sounds good.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.150
