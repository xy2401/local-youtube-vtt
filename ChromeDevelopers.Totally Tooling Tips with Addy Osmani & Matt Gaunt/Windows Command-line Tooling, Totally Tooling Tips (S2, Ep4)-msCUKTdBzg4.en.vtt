00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.250
ADDY OSMANI: So the other week,
I bought a new Windows laptop.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.580
MATT GAUNT: How come?

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.710
ADDY OSMANI: I was
curious whether-- it's

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.020
been a few years since I've
really used Windows heavily,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.560
and I was curious what
the front-end workflow

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.750
and the command line
workflow looked like there.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.600
MATT GAUNT: So what does
the front-end tooling

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.539
system look like now?

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.330
ADDY OSMANI: So the
command line workflow--

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.200
the front-end tooling workflow
isn't massively different,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.030
but to get your command line
workflow on par these days

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.530
still requires a
little bit of work.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.620
So what I was used to when I
played with Windows a few years

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.167
ago was the Windows
prompt, which

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:56.180
was this really very, very
basic update to the DOS prompt.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.440
Always seemed like
better for just managing

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.540
files than anything--

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.930
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, in some ways--

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.320
ADDY OSMANI: --super serious.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.890
MATT GAUNT: --just feel like
I was exploring my hard drive,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.640
and that was about it.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.098
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah, I'd play
with utilities there and stuff.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:08.060
But Microsoft then
did PowerShell,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.460
which was way better and
designed for automation,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.240
had much better support
for objects and variables,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.679
and had these really rich
prompts for commandlets.

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.970
But it comes with support
for auto-completion right out

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.620
of the box--

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.328
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:23.790
ADDY OSMANI: --so that's
what I want from--

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.420
MATT GAUNT: It's the kind
of thing that you can--

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.820
ADDY OSMANI: --a shell.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.970
MATT GAUNT: --take for
granted with things

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.940
like OS X and Linux.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.080
And it's like their terminals
just come with all that stuff.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.520
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.510
MATT GAUNT: It's just stock.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.260
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.670
And so another thing that
we commonly do on Mac

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.480
is we have dot files set
up with all of our aliases.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.692
And you can create your
own PowerShell profile

00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:40.400
that's got the same
type of stuff set up.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.024
MATT GAUNT: OK.

00:01:41.024 --> 00:01:43.950
ADDY OSMANI: So you can create
aliases for Sublime Text.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.840
So subl or ST will go
and fire off Sublime.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.670
So you can create
system-level aliases.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.510
You can use DOS
key as well, which

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.760
is another utility for
just creating aliases.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.270
But PowerShell's great.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.324
It doesn't quite
get you all the way.

00:01:58.324 --> 00:01:59.990
There's still a few
things missing, so--

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.801
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:03.300
ADDY OSMANI: Another
tool that I use

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.140
is ConEmu, which is
a console emulator.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.020
And it's got support
for multiple tabs.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.820
So you've got multiple
tabs in there.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.662
You can do vertical tab
splitting as well and all

00:02:12.662 --> 00:02:13.620
sorts of other layout--

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.720
MATT GAUNT: That's quite nice.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.678
ADDY OSMANI: --configs.

00:02:15.678 --> 00:02:17.420
So that's pretty nice.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.110
MATT GAUNT: Again, it still
feels like you're-- it's just

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.530
things that I've grown to
expect, I guess, or one--

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.590
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.305
MATT GAUNT: It's
one of those things.

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:26.720
If it was removed from me,
I'd probably instantly just

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.661
be like, please can I
have the tabs back now.

00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:29.410
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.410
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.166
ADDY OSMANI: So I use
ConEmu, but there's still

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.040
other things missing.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.550
So the tool that I mostly
use these days is Cmder.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.900
And Cmder is awesome.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.210
MATT GAUNT: Why is it awesome?

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.150
ADDY OSMANI: Because I said so.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.000
It's awesome because
it's like a power

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.750
utility with all of this stuff.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.560
So it's got ConEmu,
it's got PowerShell.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.665
It's using all that stuff.

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:51.600
MATT GAUNT: Oh, it's just like
a group of all the best things--

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.010
ADDY OSMANI: Yes.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.600
MATT GAUNT: --just
in one bundle.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.475
ADDY OSMANI: Exactly.

00:02:53.475 --> 00:02:56.140
It's also got Clink,
which is-- basically,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.280
it's the Windows Shell combined
with Readline, which is a GNU

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.110
library for working with Dash.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.500
Gives you better
auto-completion,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.402
gives you history
search, batch utilities.

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:07.110
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.550
ADDY OSMANI: Really nice.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.670
And my favorite
thing about Cmder

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.812
is the integration that you
can set up with other apps.

00:03:13.812 --> 00:03:16.270
So something I've tried to do
over the last couple of years

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.490
with Sublime is try
to get my editor

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.690
on screen with my
command line, just like--

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.320
MATT GAUNT: --just
somewhere else--

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.545
ADDY OSMANI: --built in.

00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:23.460
MATT GAUNT: --in the UI, yeah.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.793
ADDY OSMANI: And none of the
integrations I've ever seen

00:03:25.793 --> 00:03:27.262
have looked half decent.

00:03:27.262 --> 00:03:27.970
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.086
I tried one plug-in on Atom,
and it was just-- it sort of

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:33.990
looked like my terminal,
but it wasn't quite.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.989
And it was a bit clunky.

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:35.790
ADDY OSMANI: Yep.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.498
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:03:36.498 --> 00:03:37.660
So this just adds it in.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.280
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah,
it just adds it in.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.110
You have a single
window, drag it around.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.490
You've got your command
line at the top,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.640
you've got your Complete
Editor window at the bottom.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.955
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:45.871
ADDY OSMANI: And it's
completely configurable.

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:49.000
So you can tell it to take up
how much of the command line

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.830
window you want.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.690
You can script that.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.290
MATT GAUNT: I like it, yep.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.581
ADDY OSMANI: It's kind of neat.

00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:54.350
So you've got that.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.905
Cmder also encourages
you to install PoshGit--

00:03:56.905 --> 00:03:57.530
MATT GAUNT: OK.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.160
ADDY OSMANI: --which is a set
of utilities on top of Git.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.030
So if I go and I clone a project
on GitHub and I CD into it,

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.210
I can make some edits
and do Gits and type

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.640
in a command like
Git C. And then

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.980
I can tab through all
the options like Commit

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.610
and all of that other stuff.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.060
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.370
ADDY OSMANI: It's
just sort of nice.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.704
Nice contextual auto-completion.

00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:20.536
MATT GAUNT: Nice little
bit of sugar on top.

00:04:20.536 --> 00:04:21.760
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.680
What do you think
about Package Managers?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.650
Could you use another
one in your life?

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.260
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.000
I've got AptGet on
Linux and that, to me,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.070
just makes total sense.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.470
Home brew is the closest thing,
I think, on Mac that I have.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.420
But then it has its own
weird oddities on my machines

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.070
normally.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.940
ADDY OSMANI: I'm hearing
that you want another package

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.520
manager.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.090
MATT GAUNT: You're hearing
me wrong, but fine.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.131
ADDY OSMANI: So you want
another package manager,

00:04:46.131 --> 00:04:47.160
and Windows has got one.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.785
MATT GAUNT: OK.

00:04:47.785 --> 00:04:49.520
ADDY OSMANI: It's
called Chocolately.

00:04:52.172 --> 00:04:54.630
MATT GAUNT: That just doesn't
sound like a package manager,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.169
but fine.

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:57.960
How is Chocolately?

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.482
Is it good?

00:04:58.482 --> 00:04:59.940
ADDY OSMANI:
Chocolately is decent.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.430
You're using Atom.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.460
You've got your hipster
sticker over there.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.950
MATT GAUNT: My little
arm sticker, yeah.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.741
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah,
you've got your sticker.

00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:07.730
So you can do like
choco install atom.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.365
Just install.

00:05:08.365 --> 00:05:11.870
It gives you an update, progress
bar, and your command line

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.620
and everything.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.490
MATT GAUNT: To be
fair, with things

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.615
like that, the minute you
start getting used to it,

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:16.990
it's really, really nice.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.740
I don't know.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.785
It's nice not having to go to
a website, download the thing,

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:21.885
open up the AC, and then
do all the other stuff,

00:05:21.885 --> 00:05:22.510
so that's nice.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.640
Does it update as well?

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.640
ADDY OSMANI: I think so.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.348
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:05:25.348 --> 00:05:29.280
