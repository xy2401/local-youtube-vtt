00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:11.270
ADDY OSMANI: Hey, Matt.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.840
ROB DODSON: Hey, Addy.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.190
How's it going?

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.950
ADDY OSMANI: It's good.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.480
It's good.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.050
Did you get a haircut?

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.122
ROB DODSON: I did, a haircut,
new accent, new look, new feel.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:21.080
ADDY OSMANI: It's good.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.820
You're looking
better than before.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.530
You feel better than before?

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.420
ROB DODSON: I feel
good, yeah, yeah

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.340
ADDY OSMANI: You're not Matt.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.900
I am not.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.680
ROB DODSON: No,
hi, I'm Rob Dodson.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.800
I'm a developer advocate
on the Chrome team.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.059
ADDY OSMANI: Sure Rob,
just sell yourself.

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.100
ROB DODSON: Hello, hello.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.760
And also, if we're
selling stuff,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.460
I also host a little show on
the Chrome Developers YouTube

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.086
channel called
A11ycasts, world renown.

00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:43.876
ADDY OSMANI: Is that
what we're calling it?

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:45.250
ROB DODSON: Yes, world renowned.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.680
ADDY OSMANI: I see.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.660
ROB DODSON: People around
the world have renowned it,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.160
I think.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.859
ADDY OSMANI: OK,
all right, believe

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:50.900
what you want to believe.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.400
But today, we're
going to be talking

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.340
about accessibility
auditing, right?

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.010
ROB DODSON: Yes.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.115
ADDY OSMANI: What does your
workflow for that look like?

00:00:57.115 --> 00:00:58.370
ROB DODSON: Yeah, so
over here on my laptop,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.520
I've got a site that
I've been working on.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.970
So this is called Lifestyle.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.550
It's got some cool hipster
photos and stuff like that.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.134
People living.

00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:07.341
ADDY OSMANI: Lifestyles of
the accessible and famous?

00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:08.690
ROB DODSON: Indeed, yeah, yeah.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.180
And what I usually
do when I'm working

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.160
on improving the
accessibility of a site

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.930
is I will use the new Audits
panel in Chrome Dev Tools,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.020
which is very, very nice.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.970
If you go to create
a new audit, you'll

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.440
see that you've got a number
of options inside of there.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.230
So you could look at PWAness,
best practices, et cetera.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.790
One of the topic areas
is accessibility.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.330
So you can just go run just
an accessibility audit,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.130
if you don't feel like
doing the other tests.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.190
Here's one that I
ran against the page.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.500
And it's doing pretty OK, right?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.000
It's got a 91, not so bad.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.820
But there's definitely a few
issues that we need to fix.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.210
And in particular, one that I
see a lot is color contrast.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.690
So you've got your foreground
text maybe is little too

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.102
light on the background color.

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:54.560
One of the nice things that we
can do with the Audits panel

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.730
is we can actually dive in.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.250
And we can see which
elements specifically

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.050
have failing contrast.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.600
So here, I can see that I've
got this product card price

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.650
element.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.561
And if I click on that and
stretch this out a little bit,

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:08.810
you can see it will take me
over to my Elements panel.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.320
And I can actually scroll in
to view the actual element that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.000
is failing, which is
this price right here.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.790
ADDY OSMANI: Nice,
and it already selects

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.720
the DOM node for you?

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.120
ROB DODSON: Mm-hmm.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.950
ADDY OSMANI: That's cool.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.658
ROB DODSON: Yeah.

00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:21.620
And so one of the things
that's really helpful

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.800
is not only does this is
allow me to quickly identify

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.510
this node, but one of the
things we're working on,

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.480
which is over here in
Chrome Canary right now,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.156
is actually a color
picker that will

00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:33.530
make it a little bit easier
for you to fix those contract

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.740
issues.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.160
So if you're in something
like Chrome Canary,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.130
you can go into Chrome://flags.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.621
And you can look for the word
Developer Tools Experiments.

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.620
ADDY OSMANI: So you're
in flags and experiments.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.262
You like to live dangerously.

00:02:47.262 --> 00:02:48.470
ROB DODSON: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.636
ADDY OSMANI: So dangerously?

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:50.820
ROB DODSON: So dangerously.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.690
So we enable the Developer
Tools Experiments, right?

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.522
We step into the future.

00:02:56.522 --> 00:02:57.980
It will refresh
our browser for us.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.970
We can go back over here,
pop up open the Dev Tools,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.990
click on this little
Settings menu,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.070
go to where it
says Experiments--

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.930
dun dun dun-- and
here we can see

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.730
we've got Accessibility
Inspection as well

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.140
as Color Contrast Ratio Line.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.670
So let's see what that does.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.880
So we'll go find that same
node that was giving us

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.200
problems over here, inspect it.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.450
And then, we can see,
in our Styles panel,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.977
I've got a little color swatch.

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:26.810
I can click on that.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.450
And now, you'll see that
there is this little line

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.880
inside of my color palette.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.590
ADDY OSMANI: Fancy.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.840
ROB DODSON: So this
was actually telling us

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.120
where are our colors need
to be in order to have

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.450
sufficient color contrast.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.290
So since we're
above the line, we

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.155
get this little warning that
says we've got low contrast.

00:03:44.155 --> 00:03:45.530
I happen to know
that this is not

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.420
the final look for
this piece of UI.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.414
It's still being iterated on.

00:03:49.414 --> 00:03:51.830
But it'll be something like
this, where you've got a line.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.290
And you can tell which side is
the good side or the bad side.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.100
So I can actually just
drag this below the line.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.450
And that warning goes away.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.000
You can see over here it's
also updating my element live

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.290
in the document.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.680
And it'll tell me what the
good color contrast ratio is.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.140
So I can just grab that value
right off here, and then

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.827
go back, and just
fix it in my CSS.

00:04:10.827 --> 00:04:12.160
ADDY OSMANI: That's pretty neat.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.120
So I was trying this
out the other week.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.860
And something that
occurred to me

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.690
was that, if you,
as a developer,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.360
realize the contrast
is a little bit off,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.640
do you need to go back to
your designers at that point

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.434
and say, well, is this OK
for our brand and everything?

00:04:25.434 --> 00:04:27.350
Is that's something that
should be factored in

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.060
earlier on in the process?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.060
ROB DODSON: Ideally, yeah.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.682
There's definitely other
design tools out there.

00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:36.140
I think there's
plug-ins for Sketch

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.681
and things like
that, which will also

00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:40.460
help you look at the color
contrast for your designs

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.010
and make sure things are
not too low contrast.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.100
Anytime you can catch that
earlier in the process,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.808
make sure all the
designers are on board,

00:04:47.808 --> 00:04:49.820
and all the stakeholders
are on board,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.387
and that makes it easier when
those things come downstream

00:04:53.387 --> 00:04:54.470
for folks to implement it.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.660
And it doesn't become a
contentious issue or anything.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.250
ADDY OSMANI: Cool,
that's awesome.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.231
The Lighthouse audit also had
some other accessibility stuff

00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:03.230
in there as well, right?

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.550
So it had contrast.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.100
It was highlighting
alt attributes, too?

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.560
ROB DODSON: Alt
attributes, yeah.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.720
So Yeah, if we go back to
that report, let's see here.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.280
So yeah, a few of the things
that this site was failing--

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.010
it's missing some
alt attributes.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.632
We've got form elements that
don't have associated labels.

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:22.590
The big problem there is
you land on a control.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.940
And maybe it says
that it's a button.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.065
But it doesn't tell you
what kind of button, right?

00:05:26.065 --> 00:05:28.680
Is it the send my
social security number

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.670
to hackers button?

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.990
I don't want to click
that button, right?

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.531
I want to make sure
that I'm clicking

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.370
the right kind of controls and I
know what I'm interacting with.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.170
We've got over, I think, 32
tests, or maybe even 35 tests

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.376
in the Lighthouse
Accessibility Checker here.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:45.000
And under the hood,
these tests are all

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.890
based on a library
called aXe-core,

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.560
which is made by
some folks at Deque.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.484
So yeah, we work with
aXe-core library.

00:05:52.484 --> 00:05:54.150
We leveraged the test
from inside of it.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.940
And we integrated
it into Dev Tools.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.470
So you can hop around and
inspect the nodes real quick.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.636
ADDY OSMANI: That's awesome.

00:05:59.636 --> 00:06:02.100
So this is great, again,
for locally checking

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.060
on your accessibility issues.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.140
What about CI and continuously
monitoring your accessibility?

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.670
Is there a story for that, too?

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.878
ROB DODSON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:09.878 --> 00:06:13.650
So the Lighthouse library
itself can be used

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.580
as a standalone node module.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.820
So you can pull that
into your Ci process,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.200
if you want to do that.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.720
Or alternatively, you could
use the aXe-core library

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.490
that is powering these tests.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.500
And you could use
that standalone.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.180
The nice thing there is you
can decide which accessibility

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.310
tests you want to turn on or
off, depending on the criteria

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.450
that you're trying to meet

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.870
ADDY OSMANI: Very cool.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.670
So we've got lots
of great tooling

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.410
for accessibility auditing.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.587
What about docs or
educational material?

00:06:39.587 --> 00:06:41.170
ROB DODSON: Yes, we
have that as well.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.010
So if you go to developers.googl
e.com/web/fundam

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.000
entals/accessibility, we have a
whole section there on getting

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.100
started with
accessibility for the web.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.610
And it also includes links
to our Udacity course.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.070
So that's a multi-week hands on
experience, where you actually

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.780
build stuff, and watch
a bunch of videos,

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.897
and up to speed
on accessibility.

00:06:59.897 --> 00:07:00.855
ADDY OSMANI: Very cool.

00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:03.750
I feel like my lifestyle
is more accessible.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.245
ROB DODSON: Already, yeah.

00:07:05.245 --> 00:07:06.870
Cool, yeah, thanks
for having me today.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.920
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah,
thanks for coming down.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.003
ROB DODSON: Awesome, yeah.

00:07:09.003 --> 00:07:10.982
ADDY OSMANI: People should
check out A11ycasts.

00:07:10.982 --> 00:07:12.190
ROB DODSON: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.840
