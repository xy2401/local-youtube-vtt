[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:10.640
ADDY OSMANI: Do you
know what the top four

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.382
things to look at when it
comes to web accessibility are?

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:15.161
MATT GAUNT: Uh, no.

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:16.161
I can only think of two.

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:18.680
Like, I only think of
audio and then visual.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.400
ADDY OSMANI: So there's
visual, hearing, mobility,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.193
and cognition.

00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:23.519
MATT GAUNT: Ah, OK.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.560
So what are the last two?

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.120
ADDY OSMANI: So mobility
is where someone may not

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.580
be able to use a
mouse, or they may

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.002
need to use a keyboard to
navigate around all of your UI.

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:31.835
MATT GAUNT: OK, yep.

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:34.570
ADDY OSMANI: And
cognition is where,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.030
if you show somebody
flashing text or a site

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.430
with lots of animation, that
might cause an epileptic fit

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.600
or just cause them issues.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.020
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.520
I think I remember
someone tweeting,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.120
saying they had
a condition where

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.150
if there was loads of parallax
scrolling or something goes on,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.860
it makes them feel really
nauseous, because there's tons

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.054
of weird movements going on.

00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:52.470
ADDY OSMANI: When
doesn't parallax

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.928
scrolling make everyone feel
nauseous is the real question.

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:56.140
MATT GAUNT: That's true.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.640
ADDY OSMANI: So
thankfully, there's

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.410
a few tools to help with web
accessibility issue diagnosis.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.290
We should go through them.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.900
The first is the Chrome
Accessibility Developer Tools,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.502
which is like a Chrome
extension you can grab.

00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:11.960
I'm a bit of a
douche, so I'm going

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.800
to run it against your site.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.102
MATT GAUNT: Mine isn't too bad.

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:16.060
It's not great, though.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.840
ADDY OSMANI: I guess
we'll find out.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.440
MATT GAUNT: Yes.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.250
ADDY OSMANI: So we're going to
hop into DevTools in the Audits

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.750
panel, check accessibility,
and go and run it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.320
against this site.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.110
You've got a few passing
tests, and you've

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.190
got a few tests that
are not passing.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.230
So we're going to look at those.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.300
The first one is yellow
and says the text

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.520
elements should have
a reasonable contrast

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.512
ratio, Matthew.

00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:38.970
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, I set the
opacity low on some of the menu

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.890
items that aren't selected.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.020
So I need to bump them up
or find a different way

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.770
of visualizing it.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.686
ADDY OSMANI: One of the
nice things about this

00:01:44.686 --> 00:01:46.440
is if you hover over
any of the DOMNodes,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.950
it will actually
visualize it over

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.070
in the Preview pane,
which is kind of cool.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.778
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.270
So one of the other
things I found,

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.640
because I have another issue
on my site, which is the About

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.530
menu item doesn't
actually explain anything

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.600
about what's going to happen.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.123
But if you go into the
Accessbility options,

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.706
like in the Elements
panel, and you've

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:05.930
got the styles and
computer styles,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.150
there's an Accessibility
drop-down that you get.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.389
The nice thing with
this is it actually

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.972
shows you what the
screen reader would

00:02:10.972 --> 00:02:13.792
say based on what it's got.

00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:15.375
And the main reason
I like this is, A,

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:16.885
it's a nice live representation.

00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:18.260
It's something
that's easy for me

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.050
to go, oh, OK, this is what
the screen we would say.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.530
But it also shows
you area labels

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.780
that you could put that would
affect the screen reader

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.150
and what it says,
which I kind of like,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.380
because I wouldn't have
known what the right area

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.042
labels would have been.

00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:33.250
So it's just kind of a nice
way of educating yourself

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.860
as you're going
along, figuring out

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.420
what you can change to
get better screen reader

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.670
support or anything like that.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.420
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.400
MATT GAUNT: It's nice.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.730
ADDY OSMANI: So the
thing that powers

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.900
the accessibility
developer-produced extension

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.240
is actually called
Accessibility Developer Tools.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.710
It's like this node module--
it's not necessarily

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.460
just a node module,
but basically, it

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.501
gives you all of the
functionality that you might

00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:56.550
need to go and run
these tests locally

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.880
or hook up to
continuous integration

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.020
in case you wanted to
write accessibility tests

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.300
alongside your unit tests.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.400
MATT GAUNT: Is that running
it through something

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.430
like PhantomJS?

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.150
ADDY OSMANI: So I wrote
a while back a module

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.530
called A11Y-- A-11-Y. It gives
you basically a CLI and CI

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.760
module for doing that.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.170
And you can just go and
run it against Travis and--

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.340
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.756
ADDY OSMANI: --it'll
do its thing.

00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:21.060
MATT GAUNT: Drop in your CI.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.326
ADDY OSMANI: Drop it in.

00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:24.085
Have you heard of Tenon?

00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:24.740
MATT GAUNT: (WHISPERING)
Yes, I have.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.200
ADDY OSMANI: You have?

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.730
You have.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.740
So Tenon gives you
this nice web UI

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.540
for just doing nice, basic
web accessibility testing.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.090
I run it against
developers.google.com,

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.490
and we have a ton of missing
alt attributes, which

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.630
we could probably fix up.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.702
MATT GAUNT: So
Tenon is super nice.

00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:45.160
The only criticism
I have with it--

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.493
it's great because you don't
have to do any [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.731
It's super easy to get a
gut check of where you are.

00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:51.730
But the flip side is when
I ran my site through,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.270
it says there's no
problems with it,

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.200
which we both know is now a lie.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.510
So it's useful for a gut check.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.027
And it's super low effort to
get it running on your site.

00:04:01.027 --> 00:04:04.050
But I question it, I guess.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.740
ADDY OSMANI: So Tenon runs
against the Web Content

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.907
Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.

00:04:08.907 --> 00:04:10.990
And I think the Accessibility
Developer Tools just

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.330
has a good set of general
accessibility best practices

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.500
it tries to check against.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.440
So they're checking for
related but not necessarily

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.052
the exact same set of things.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:21.760
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.635
ADDY OSMANI: They're
both worth checking out.

00:04:23.635 --> 00:04:26.420
MATT GAUNT: So the
other one is tota11y.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.040
ADDY OSMANI: Totally
Tooling Tips?

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.980
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.080
T-O-T-A-1-1-Y. Basically,
it's got a super awesome logo.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.690
But what it is is it's
basically a bookmarklet.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.972
So you can drag it
to your toolbar.

00:04:39.972 --> 00:04:41.930
And then when you're in
your site, click on it,

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.340
and it adds a little button onto
the bottom of your web page.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.044
And the main reason it's
nice is just the fact

00:04:48.044 --> 00:04:50.210
that it breaks up all the
different criteria of what

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.140
you could look for in
terms of accessibility

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.710
into nice little chunks that
you just focus on that one area.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.710
And then it starts adding
things into the page.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.344
So with the contrast
links, it will actually

00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:02.510
hover over the buttons, add
a little button, saying,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.889
this is a problem area.

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:05.680
And it's just nice.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.480
It's very lightweight,
it's super simple.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.280
And I think the way
that it breaks stuff up

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.910
is if you've got a ton of
stuff wrong with your site,

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.941
it's at least manageable chunks.

00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:16.080
So I think it's just nice.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.080
It's a nice little tool.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.960
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.320
I've got to give a mention to
ally.js by Rodney Rehm, which

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.577
is this little helper
library that helps you

00:05:23.577 --> 00:05:25.410
with some of the workflows
you normally have

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.810
when you're trying to make
your app a little bit more

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.720
accessible.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.647
So it makes things like
trying to figure out

00:05:29.647 --> 00:05:31.730
what elements are considered
focusable on the page

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.050
a little bit easier,
trapping focus

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.949
navigation to a particular
DOM subtree, something that

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.240
would have helped me, actually.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.100
So I was trying to make
this navigation drawer

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.820
keyboard-accessible
the other day.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.430
And I wanted to avoid you
tabbing through the navigation

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.660
and then going back--

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.910
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, getting to--

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.230
ADDY OSMANI: --and it tabbing
to the parts of the page.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.420
So that might have
helped with that.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.020
And it's just really useful for
querying the DOM for focusable

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.840
or tabbable elements.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.460
Check it out.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.660
It's pretty decent.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.180
So I have some web
accessibility pro tips.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.930
MATT GAUNT: Go on.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:02.840
ADDY OSMANI: They're
not really pro tips.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.510
I'm incompetent.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.239
But they're good.

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:05.780
They're good things
to watch out for.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.100
MATT GAUNT: They're
solid advice.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.230
ADDY OSMANI: They're
solid advice.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.840
So the first thing
to keep an eye on

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.300
is making sure that the
components and elements

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.290
in your page can be
accessed using a keyboard

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.497
and navigated around
using a keyboard.

00:06:16.497 --> 00:06:18.080
Next, make sure that
your elements can

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.570
be used with a screen reader.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.619
So for example, if I go to
your website and I turn on--

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:24.952
SPEAKER 1: Welcome to Voiceover.

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:25.796
ADDY OSMANI: --voiceover--

00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:27.270
SPEAKER 1: Voiceover
speaks descriptions

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.270
of items on the screen.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.986
ADDY OSMANI: It's
basically what it does.

00:06:29.986 --> 00:06:31.360
SPEAKER 2: Voiceover
on Chromium.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.161
Unit testing a service worker.
[INAUDIBLE] vertical line

00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:34.660
Matt Gaunt.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.925
ADDY OSMANI: So it
does all of that.

00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:38.300
MATT GAUNT: The
vertical line one

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.870
is the interesting one where
I've somehow added my name

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.730
to the single vertical line.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.440
So there's some issues there.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.900
ADDY OSMANI: We've already
discovered in this episode

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.733
that you have multiple
issues with your site

00:06:47.733 --> 00:06:49.132
probably worth checking out.

00:06:49.132 --> 00:06:50.340
MATT GAUNT: [LAUGHS]

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.048
ADDY OSMANI: People
should also make sure

00:06:52.048 --> 00:06:54.380
that their apps
work without sound.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.760
So things like games might be
worth keeping that in mind.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.260
MATT GAUNT: Something like Air
Horn, though, where all it is

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.907
is a button that makes a horn.

00:07:01.907 --> 00:07:04.323
ADDY OSMANI: You could probably
make that accessible, like

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:06.005
show a bubble or something.

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:07.421
MATT GAUNT: Because
I didn't know.

00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:10.240
It was just a text that
just goes, whooo-on.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.414
ADDY OSMANI: [LAUGHS]
People should

00:07:12.414 --> 00:07:14.080
make sure their apps
work without color,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.110
because some people are
colorblind and don't see

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.277
the full spectrum of colors.

00:07:17.277 --> 00:07:17.943
MATT GAUNT: Yup.

00:07:17.943 --> 00:07:19.650
ADDY OSMANI: And
people should make sure

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.414
that their web apps work in
high-contrast mode as well.

00:07:22.414 --> 00:07:24.830
MATT GAUNT: Which is the problem
that I've got on my site.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.530
ADDY OSMANI: You have
multiple problems, Matt.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.696
These are just some of the
ones that we can actually

00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:29.600
address using tools.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.600
MATT GAUNT: Thanks, man.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.430
ADDY OSMANI: I try.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.930
I try.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.190
