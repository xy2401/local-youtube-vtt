[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.731
ADDY OSMANI: So build
processes are important.

00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:23.949
Important because when
you want to be fast,

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.740
you have to sort of
give up the things that

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.837
are slowing you down.

00:00:26.837 --> 00:00:27.670
MATT GAUNT: T-shirt.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.130
ADDY OSMANI: T-shirt.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.090
It's a T-shirt slogan.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.250
MATT GAUNT: Love it.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.169
He says wearing
a Yeoman T-shirt.

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.460
ADDY OSMANI: Product placement.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.950
MATT GAUNT: [LAUGHS] But
you're completely right.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.280
Things like minifying your
CSS and your JavaScript,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.220
optimizing images.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.100
Like, all of that stuff
is really laborious

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.600
if you have to do it manually.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.290
So getting it in
your build process

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.940
makes total sense,
because just whenever you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.641
do a build of your site, it's
just done, taken care of.

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:54.391
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:00:54.391 --> 00:01:00.030
This sort of fits into my three
tiers of optimization tooling.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.090
I should make a pamphlet.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.870
MATT GAUNT: I feel
like an advert

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.300
is about to start playing.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.319
That's what it feels
like right now.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.569
ADDY OSMANI: It's life advice.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:07.380
See the difference?

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.880
OK.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.710
So there's sort of
a baseline of tools

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.080
that everybody should
be doing these days.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.300
Hashtag I hate.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.200
Data roaming charges.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.080
I don't want anyone shipping
1,000 images down the line.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.950
So the baseline is you
should be at least minifying

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.930
your styles and your JavaScript,
optimizing your images,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.990
using compression
on the server side,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.760
using async scripts, leverage
caching, [? weed ?] redirects.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.019
That's the baseline.

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:35.310
Then we've got stuff that
you and I have been exploring

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.510
a lot lately, which is sort
of get fast and stay fast,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.530
tools like things that'll help
you in-line your critical path

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.920
CSS so that you can
improve first render.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.340
Things that will help
you remove unused CSS.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.490
MATT GAUNT: Like, a ton
of those things-- what

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.020
I'm finding myself doing is
I'm using the build process,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.530
like building out custom,
little things where basically, I

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.370
can still control what
the critical path is,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.650
and the build process is
just helping me manage it.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.110
Like, I know there are
build process steps

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.850
where it's like they'll
do everything for you.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.684
And it's like magic.

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:07.141
And that scares
me, because I don't

00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:09.830
feel like I understand it enough
to know whether those tools are

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.310
doing the right thing or not.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.060
So I'm still in, like,
the learning phase.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.760
But I'm using the build
process just to make it easier

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.030
for me to explore.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.260
So there's Web Starter Kit.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.885
There's also Polymer
Starter Kit, which

00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:21.730
is very similar
to Web Starter Kit

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.110
except it's got extra
plugins specific to Polymer,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.690
like Vulcanize and
things like that.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.320
But then Yeoman is basically
like you can just go in

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.880
and it'll ask you what
generator you want to use

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.630
is what they call,
where you can then just

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.220
generate any style of project.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.595
So if you wanted
to use something

00:02:36.595 --> 00:02:39.990
like Angular, or React,
or whatever new hotness

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.831
is out there,
chances are there's

00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:44.080
a generator that will give
you a build process already

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.990
for those things.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.280
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.800
Exactly.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.341
And like, one thing
I find-- so we've

00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:49.880
got all of the baseline
performance optimization

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.960
is pretty much covered
by Web Starter Kit.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.160
One thing I find a
lot of agencies doing

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.610
is that they'll use Yeoman to
scaffold out their projects.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.110
And they'll go into Web Starter
Kit, and they'll take a look

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.110
and say, OK, well, we're
interested in the image

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.720
optimization parts or the
script minification parts.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.479
We're just going to steal,
like, 70% of this file and just,

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:09.770
like, drop it into our project.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.270
And that's perfectly fine.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.937
Pick and choose what
makes sense to you.

00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:16.186
MATT GAUNT: So the way that
I started doing this now--

00:03:16.186 --> 00:03:18.560
and I know you kind of don't
agree with this approach.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.780
But I--

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.890
ADDY OSMANI: I'm just
going to walk out.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.640
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, you should.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.570
So I have one Gulp file
that, basically, you can do

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.740
a thing like require-directory.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.310
And then any JavaScript
file within that directory,

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.670
it will basically
take the Gulp tasks

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.432
from those each
individual files.

00:03:33.432 --> 00:03:34.890
And then you can
basically use them

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.490
as you would just one,
big, long Gulp file.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.990
And the reason I'm
doing that is you

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.230
can split it out into styles,
and scripts, and images.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.230
Like, each section will
deal with its own thing.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.354
And then I can copy those
files into a new project,

00:03:46.354 --> 00:03:48.200
delete any old ones
that I don't want,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.666
and just change the directories.

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:52.510
And it's like a really nice
way of getting reuse out

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.592
of my Gulp files, because
before, when I had big ones,

00:03:55.592 --> 00:03:57.050
everything would
just become messy.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.200
It'd be hard to maintain or
understand where problems were.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.100
Whereas when I've got
them in multiple files,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.360
everything just sort
of becomes much easier

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.092
to manage, and
maintain, and share.

00:04:06.092 --> 00:04:08.050
ADDY OSMANI: You've been
demoted from colleague

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.742
to desk occupant.

00:04:09.742 --> 00:04:11.670
MATT GAUNT: Harsh.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.880
ADDY OSMANI: This approach
is actually pretty legit.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.380
If you're finding that you've
got a really, really long Gulp

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.399
file, splitting them
out totally makes sense.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.732
The reason we haven't done
it in some of our boilerplate

00:04:20.732 --> 00:04:22.336
projects is that
for beginners, you

00:04:22.336 --> 00:04:23.710
don't want them
to have to, like,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.070
think about one other thing.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.160
And it also gets a little bit
trickier to debug if you've got

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.830
multiple tasks and
different files

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.915
that depend on each other.

00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:33.880
It's not a whole lot more,
but it's just another thing

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.290
you've got to think about.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.580
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.010
This is where I always get to
a weird point of, like, best

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.620
practice versus ease of use.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.505
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:04:44.505 --> 00:04:46.755
MATT GAUNT: And I always
tend to go for best practice,

00:04:46.755 --> 00:04:50.020
because like, if you ever look
at any of the native platforms,

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.270
they always just say, this
is the right way of doing

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.730
something for this platform,
or this ID, or library,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.530
or whatever.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.830
There's no middle ground
where you could do something,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.579
because it's easier.

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:00.620
ADDY OSMANI: No, that's--

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.599
MATT GAUNT: I'm not
saying you're wrong, but--

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:03.890
ADDY OSMANI: It's totally fair.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.910
MATT GAUNT: I remember when we
were-- like a little while ago,

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.030
you gave me a rundown of
one of your presentations.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.740
One of the bits was
on build processes.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.150
And you were like, everyone
should just use Grunt.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.410
Actually, Gulp is coming out.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.659
It's the new kid on the block.

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:20.725
It's kind of cool.

00:05:20.725 --> 00:05:22.525
Everyone should just use Gulp.

00:05:22.525 --> 00:05:24.150
Actually, there's
this new thing that's

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.610
kind of coming out
called Broccoli

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.770
that's also a build process.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.590
Then again, [? MPM ?] scripts is
also coming, so maybe use that.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.500
ADDY OSMANI: Yup.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.041
MATT GAUNT: And in my head, I
realized-- this was at the time

00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:37.410
where I just learned Grunt and
I was switching over to Gulp,

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.680
because it seemed like that
was getting used a lot.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.580
And I realized that, basically,
all of the web tooling

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.460
ecosystem is basically a "Game
of Thrones," where the minute

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.130
I fall in love with one, it's
going to die and be replaced.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.600
So there's a bit of me that
feels like I should just

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.400
never get attached to any of my
tools, because sooner or later,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.680
by getting attached,
I'm almost dooming it.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.030
