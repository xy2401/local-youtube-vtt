00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.050
MATT: So do you know what my
favorite command line tool is?

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.341
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
(SINGING) Matt loves tools yeah.

00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:20.305
ADDY: No.

00:00:20.305 --> 00:00:21.929
What's your favorite
command line tool?

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.870
FEMALE COMPUTER
VOICE: That was weird.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.180
ADDY: So we're using the Say
command, which is probably

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.590
the best of the commands.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.950
MATT: I do actually
love command line tools.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.530
Like recently, someone pointed
out the delight of Stop Files.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.570
You know GitHub has their
whole dotfiles.github.io,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.990
and it's literally
just a ton of people

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.310
and just their dotfile configs.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.190
And it's basically like dotfiles
are the things that just

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.420
set up your profile, right?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.390
So on Linux, you have
Bash M OSX, right?

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.090
ADDY: Yeah.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.430
MATT: They both use Bash.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.790
And it's basically like
you can put loads of things

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.591
that preset Bash to do all sorts
of crazy stuff just for you.

00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:05.090
ADDY: Right.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.050
So if you're someone that finds
themselves using the command

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.090
line quite a lot, and
you find that there's

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.750
a common set of
tools or workflows

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.690
that you use every day, it's
a good idea to alias them.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.871
So I use aliases a
lot in my workflow.

00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:17.370
MATT: Yeah.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.140
Because I ended up going through
your dotfiles, and there's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.510
some good things in there.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.120
I got massively confused.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.650
ADDY: There's Probably some
terrible things in there

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.060
as well.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.460
MATT: They're also not
your original dotfiles.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.770
You stole them
from someone else.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.269
ADDY: No.

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:32.370
I stole them from
Mathias Bynens,

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.357
who has probably one of the
best sets of dotfiles ever.

00:01:35.357 --> 00:01:35.940
MATT: He does.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.070
There's tons of
good stuff in there.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.250
I just got super confused
and I forgot everything.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.870
And now I'm probably up to the
point where you are as well.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.770
But I love them.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.520
One of the common
things that I like doing

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.800
is I have aliases, where
essentially I just C-S-P.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.670
And it literally just goes
to code or sites or projects.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.972
It's just preset directories,
and I just type one letter,

00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:55.805
and it's just there.

00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:57.650
ADDY: That's kind
of funny because I

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.924
find that I use some of
the same letters for stuff,

00:01:59.924 --> 00:02:01.590
but it means something
different for me.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.805
So I've got S set
up to do Get Status.

00:02:03.805 --> 00:02:07.080
So if I want to find out the
status of my current branch,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.300
I can just type in S.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.290
So something I do
every day is I end up

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.630
cloning repos and
opening up in my editor.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.741
So I use a clone command that
lets me just go and fetch

00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:17.240
a repo.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.915
I just type in clone repo name.

00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:21.820
It'll clone the repo,
check it out, CD into it,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.580
and then open it
up in my editor.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.170
MATT: So will it clone it just
into that editor you're in,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.390
or will it even go to
the point where it's

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.650
just straight into projects?

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.441
ADDY: It'll create a
new directory for you.

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:31.201
You can tell it what
parent directory

00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:32.200
you want it to write to.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.510
MATT: Nice.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.370
ADDY: It's kind of useful.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.744
MATT: That's the
one thing that I

00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:37.490
must admit I'm finding more
and more that the Get commands,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.990
I'm probably going to go through
a lot of people's and steal

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.610
some things, because I'm still
doing a lot of that manually.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.860
It's getting more
and more cumbersome.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.642
But it's insane.

00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:48.100
I've just gotten
to the point where

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.531
I feel like everyone should
just spend a bit of time

00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:52.530
playing with their terminal,
just setting it up.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.447
Because the other thing
I did was set up .sh.

00:02:55.447 --> 00:02:57.780
And the main reason I did
that was because of the themes

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.290
that everyone has, and
then you've got plug-ins.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.390
The only one I'm aware that
I'm using is GitHub plug-in.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.335
So if I'm in the terminal,
it's GitHub Repo.

00:03:05.335 --> 00:03:07.650
It will go, here's the
branch that they're on.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.290
And then it'll put a little star
whether there's change files

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.590
or not that it's committing.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.252
ADDY: So .sh is really useful
for visualizing some additional

00:03:15.252 --> 00:03:17.585
information in the context
that you're in at the moment,

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:18.501
which is kind of cool.

00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:21.250
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.145
ADDY: Speaking of the command
line, I love using iTerm2.

00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:25.770
And it's got some
really nice features.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.420
So in addition to having
a really rich ecosystem

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.300
of themes-- again, I'm
using Seti UI as my default

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.170
theme in the command line now.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.900
It's also got support
for a history feature.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.687
So it'll record all of the
different console information,

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:43.020
commands that you've been
using the last couple of days.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.550
And you can scrub back
and forth through history.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.059
So you can see, well, I
use these four or five

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.850
commands every day.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.340
Maybe I should alias them.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.489
MATT: That's pretty cool.

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.280
I think I've just gotten
to the point where

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.750
I'm just making up as I go
along what I alias and whatnot.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.294
That's quite a nice
way of doing it.

00:03:58.294 --> 00:03:59.960
MALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Your face is weird.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.387
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:02.387 --> 00:04:03.720
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: You suck.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.010
MALE COMPUTER VOICE: Not
as much as your face.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.560
