[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.631
ADDY: We do a whole lot of
mobile web development, right?

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:22.130
MATT: Yes.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.690
ADDY: And it's important to be
properly cross device testing

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.340
stuff so it looks beautiful,
and it's fast and performant

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.039
and everything.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:30.580
MATT: We try.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.610
ADDY: We try.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.890
There are a lot of
tools involved in that.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.944
So what do you use?

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:37.610
MATT: There are lots
of tools out there.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.870
What I use though is
probably a bad example.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.870
Like, I think one
of my main issues

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.316
is a lot of these tools are
really hard to just get set up

00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:49.500
and working all
together and just happy.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.600
So for me, I use
Browsersync, but I'm really

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.095
heavily relying on DevTools
like the Device Emulation Mode.

00:00:56.095 --> 00:00:59.140
And I'm still doing
the browser wobbling

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.270
backwards and forwards.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.020
ADDY: Device Mode
has got presets

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.770
for all the devices in there.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.590
MATT: I know, but the problem
is like DevTools takes up

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.590
x amount of space,
and then you've got--

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.330
ADDY: This is what
you've got to like--

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.450
so I've got a second monitor
specifically for my full screen

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.695
DevTools, and you can--

00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:16.570
MATT: Yeah, but then I
need a second monitor.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.815
Like I do a lot of it just
on my laptop, nothing else.

00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:21.595
So I get what you mean, though.

00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:23.720
Like if I could just stick
to Device Mode, I would.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.720
But DevTools just
doesn't mung well with me

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.400
in my head in Device
Mode on this one screen.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.900
ADDY: Yeah.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.530
MATT: That's the only thing.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.363
ADDY: All right, it
sounds like something we

00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:34.010
could be doing better.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.160
So I use BrowserStack
pretty heavily.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.240
It's great for just--
so BrowserStack

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.790
is like a cloud-based
service where

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.110
you've got a subscription.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.880
And you can just fire
off URLs and open them up

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.130
in different OSs,
different mobile devices.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.470
Here I've got like
my site loaded up

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.370
on iOS on an iPhone 6 Plus.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.480
And I can control the device.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.919
I can navigate on here.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:00.335
It's not just a
static screenshot,

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:02.850
so it's actually pretty useful.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.250
And I find BrowserStack
pretty useful.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.030
It's got support for
screenshots and all that stuff.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.500
MATT: I've found BrowserStack
to be really useful when

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.002
you want to do manual testings.

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:14.210
So literally, you're making
changes-- especially when

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.667
you do local host tunneling.

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.000
You can just make local changes.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.875
It's almost immediately
back on the emulator.

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:22.300
You can scroll around, and
it's great for, like I say,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.890
manual testing.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.110
I've used Saucelabs where
I've actually created scripts

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.300
to literally just take
screenshots of it,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.790
run simple tests like how
long it takes pages to load,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.702
different things like that.

00:02:34.702 --> 00:02:36.660
And that was quite a
while ago that I did that.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.005
Like now you've got
things like web page test

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:39.296
for performance and everything.

00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:42.490
But Saucelabs seems like it's
more geared towards automation

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.030
of tests.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.670
ADDY: Yeah, so we use
Saucelabs for things

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.800
like continuous integration.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.160
So say you've got
[? a per ?] request

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.470
that you want to make sure
works across all your target

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.820
browsers.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.670
Saucelabs is perfect for
just nailing that use case.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.356
BrowserStack's
really good, I think,

00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:01.980
if you're working on
personal projects.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.070
And there are people that use
BrowserStack in sort of a CI

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.516
setup as well with Selenium.

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:09.015
What else?

00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:12.400
So I think you and I both
use Browsersync actually.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.594
MATT: So I never used to
use Browsersync because--

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:16.760
ADDY: And then you met me,
and your life was better.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.410
MATT: No.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.160
I learned about
Browsersync because of you.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.910
But the thing that
you never told to me

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.880
was that you-- so when
you're in the Gulp file,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.270
you can actually just define
a proxy for Browsersync

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.560
to actually go through.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.620
ADDY: At some point,
I expect you to read--

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.510
MATT: It's never
going to happen, Addy.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.730
It's never going to happen.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.830
Why do you think we
keep on doing this?

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.210
So you can define a
proxy, which in this case,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.940
I just say the
proxy is local host.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.645
And then what happens is I
can have an Nginx server,

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:49.277
and then Browsersync will
create a separate port.

00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:50.860
And it will just
inject the JavaScript

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.270
that Browsersync needs to work,
which you never told me about.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.200
So I've only just
learned about it,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.210
but it means that now I can
have the devices like this

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.610
and it'll sync scrolls.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.850
It'll sync touches.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.730
It does whatever I tell it to
do, and that's like awesome.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.840
And yeah, it's just
any visual changes

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.510
that I make in terms of
code, it will just reload,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.040
and it will just happen,
which is really, really nice.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.160
Because you have devices
like this on your desk,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.959
or I even have a
couple of browsers

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.570
just on my desktop
machine running,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.844
and I can just do any kind of
commands on here, any actions,

00:04:25.844 --> 00:04:28.010
and it's just matched across
all the browsers or all

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.840
the devices.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.520
ADDY: Yeah,
Browsersync's awesome.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.240
I think we covered it
in another episode,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.520
but it's also got
this really nice UI

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.760
for configuring
network throttling,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.980
configuring do you want it
to sync clicks and forms

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.860
and scrolls and all
that other stuff.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.190
So Browsersync's probably my
favorite cross device testing

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.400
tool, I'd say.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.360
The other thing that
we use pretty heavily,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.120
it's just like
regular old VM setup.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.190
So some people use VirtualBox.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.090
I use VMware.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.620
But it's really nice being
able to easily fire up

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.650
old versions of VMs
with IE and Edge

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.109
and all those other
things on them.

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:04.941
MATT: Yeah, I don't
have a Windows machines,

00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:07.140
so I pretty much rely
on the VMware images--

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.089
well, sorry, the VirtualBox
images-- because for me,

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:13.380
it's much easier than using
something like BrowserStack

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.857
or Saucelabs when I want to do
a quick test to do it locally.

00:05:16.857 --> 00:05:18.690
It works a little bit
better, in my opinion.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.550
And it's the same with
emulators for mobile devices,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.220
especially Safari's,
the iOS emulator

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.410
is really, really good.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.860
Android, eh, not so
much, but you know.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.140
ADDY: So actually,
there's something

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.310
that I came across when
I was in Tokyo recently.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.120
And it's a tool that's been
in development for two years.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.550
And it kind of
blows the water out

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.080
of any other cross device
testing thing for Android.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.940
MATT: Yeah.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.480
ADDY: I think it's
called Open STF.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.140
It's by two guys that
work at CyberAgent.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.370
It basically is the kitchen
sink for mobile device testing.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.760
It gives you this really
beautiful visual catalog

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.450
of all the devices
you've connected up.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.880
You can easily control them.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.130
Are you familiar with DevTools
Screencasting feature?

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.690
MATT: Yes.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.150
ADDY: So this
basically does that,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.660
but for all these other
devices you plugged in.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.260
So DevTools Screencast is
great for a single device.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.190
This is great for like
a multitude of them,

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.010
where you want to
set up a device lab.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.932
MATT: And this is very
much like-- I always

00:06:18.932 --> 00:06:21.390
see this as like a supplement
to something like Browsersync

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.650
because this basically helps
you control all the devices

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.427
in terms of
launching the browser

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:28.260
and pointing them to a
particular URL, which

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.364
is the one bit that I
hate about all of this.

00:06:30.364 --> 00:06:31.780
And it's pretty
much all I've ever

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.670
done with the many mobile device
lab stuff with Pete LePage.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.174
That entire focus is how do I
launch a browser with this URL?

00:06:40.174 --> 00:06:42.090
And it seems that they've
basically taken that

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.740
and then just put it
on steroids and made

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.820
it ridiculously awesome.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.445
ADDY: This is just
the best thing ever.

00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:49.134
It's so, so awesome.

00:06:49.134 --> 00:06:51.050
MATT: So I guess we just
need to go set it up.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.466
ADDY: Yeah, I definitely want
to get the set up in Google.

00:06:53.466 --> 00:06:55.980
And there's a lot of people
that would benefit from it.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.120
MATT: No, no, no, we're going
to keep this for ourselves.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.110
ADDY: Just ourselves,
nobody else.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.110
MATT: No one else
can touch it-- never.
