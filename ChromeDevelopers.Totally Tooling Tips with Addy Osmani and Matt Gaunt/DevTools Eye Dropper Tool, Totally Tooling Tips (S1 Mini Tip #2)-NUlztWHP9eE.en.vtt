00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.791
MATT GAUNT: Um, so, yeah,
what happened at JQuery UK?

00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:14.040
ADDY OSMANI: Nothing, nothing.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.580
It was all flawless, and
I didn't get kicked off

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.936
stage in any way.

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:19.310
MATT GAUNT: I
heard the opposite.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.780
ADDY OSMANI: That's hearsay.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.196
MATT GAUNT: What sort of things
did you cover on you talk?

00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:24.450
What was the talk about?

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.210
ADDY OSMANI: I can show you--

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.670
MATT GAUNT: Do it.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.430
ADDY OSMANI: --some of the
stuff that was in the talk.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.520
MATT GAUNT: What is in
the world of DevTools?

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.730
ADDY OSMANI: So much stuff.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.230
All right.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.190
So the first thing that I talked
about, well, one of the things

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.500
I talked about was a new
Eye Dropper, new plan

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.520
in the DevTools.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.680
So instead of just being
able to select a color,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.030
you can actually get this
nice magnifying glass

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.949
that lets you select any image
or any artifact in the page

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.990
and just grab a color from
it and start using it.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.450
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.300
ADDY OSMANI: Which
is kind of useful,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.841
so you don't need to go and use
an external tool to get that.

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:54.630
It's just straight in
the Elements panel.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.790
MATT GAUNT: And then if
you've Workspaces set up,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.810
it'll save it
straight to your CSS.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.685
ADDY OSMANI: Exactly.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:00:59.750
Oh, you use Workspaces.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.200
You're already on top
of all that stuff.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.640
MATT GAUNT: I'm aware of it.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.973
ADDY OSMANI: You're aware of it.

00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:03.800
OK.
