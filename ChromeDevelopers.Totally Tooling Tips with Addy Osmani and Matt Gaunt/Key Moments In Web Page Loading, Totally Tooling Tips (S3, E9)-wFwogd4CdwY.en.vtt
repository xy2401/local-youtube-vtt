00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.710
ADDY: So we've been talking
a bunch about web performance

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.340
lately, and the term
first meaningful paint

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.330
has come up a bunch.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.970
MATT: I've been avoiding
all those discussions, just

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.852
purely from the
standpoint of everyone's

00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:22.919
going to have an opinion.

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.460
They're always going
to be different.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.590
And it doesn't matter
because everyone's

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.700
going to have a
different web app that

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.690
needs different things.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.148
ADDY: You realize
your site is then

00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:31.047
going to become the
focus of this episode.

00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:32.380
MATT: It's because it's so good.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.620
ADDY: Fantastic.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.426
So the Chromium Loading
Performance group

00:00:36.426 --> 00:00:37.800
had this really
nice thread where

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.020
they walk through
what they thought

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.230
first meaningful paint
was, and I thought it would

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.313
be good to summarize that.

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:44.070
So there's sort
of three key user

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.070
moments people need
to keep an eye on when

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.450
it comes to this stuff.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.700
There's is it happening-- so
time to first paint; is it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.740
useful-- so time to
first meaningful paint;

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.970
and is usable-- so
time to stable layout.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.060
So let's walk through
all of that stuff

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.620
in the context of your site.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.101
So this is your staging site,
which you tell me is fast.

00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:05.850
MATT: It's faster.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060
ADDY: Faster.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.675
We're going to try
this out on GPRS.

00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:12.050
And so I've GPRS-ed it up.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.670
Currently in timeline.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.069
And you've got all these
transitions and things

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.610
in your site.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.750
So we've clicked on
a link, and we've

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.010
got this loading indicator.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.510
It's nice.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.220
Ooh, look at that.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.620
It's nice and--

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.102
MATT: So that happens
after the first render.

00:01:27.102 --> 00:01:27.810
That's important.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.880
You don't just load up
my site and you get that.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.811
ADDY: So this is your first
paint, in this particular case.

00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:34.560
MATT: When you're doing
a navigation, yes.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.143
ADDY: Yeah, you're
doing a navigation.

00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:38.652
And then you go straight
for the content right after.

00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:40.110
MATT: Yeah, so all
that's happening

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.790
is when you go from the
first pages to static render,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.260
it'll animate out.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.830
And before it starts
the animation,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.329
it does a query to get the extra
content for whatever you're

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.130
going to go to.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.986
So once it's done
the animation now,

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:52.360
if the query isn't
finished, then

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.840
it shows up the spin
as saying, right, we'll

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.780
wait until it's done.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.090
Once it's done, loads it
all up and animates in.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.590
ADDY: Cool.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.120
Now, the is it
happening, user moments,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.660
to the time to
first paint, usually

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.076
the things that
that would include

00:02:05.076 --> 00:02:06.926
are like your splash
screen loading up,

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:09.009
if you have a splash screen,
a loading indicator--

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.300
so your site's got a loading
indicator-- basically

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.840
any feedback that lets the
user know that navigation

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.330
has started in the page.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.640
MATT: So I'm going to
debate that somewhat

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.519
because my site only does
the loading indicator when

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.310
it's going from one
transition to the next.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.270
The first render, if
you control-refresh it,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.620
is just a static render.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.615
It's important because
it's faster, I think.

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:32.865
ADDY: It's important because
it makes you look better.

00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:34.550
MATT: No, so I think
everyone should

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.633
be going for a static
render for their first load,

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:38.819
because otherwise
you're sending HTML.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.610
You're sending CSS.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.360
You're sending Java Script just
to do a load, like just showing

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.230
a loading spinner on a splash
screen, which, in some cases,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.312
maybe it's unavoidable.

00:02:47.312 --> 00:02:49.520
But I think generally, people
should try and avoid it

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.353
as much as they can.

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:52.885
ADDY: So the is it
useful moments or time

00:02:52.885 --> 00:02:54.730
to first meaningful
paint is usually

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.820
focused on paints of
your above-the-fold,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.850
like your body text, your
headline text, maybe a hero

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.720
image.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.350
In your case, you're using like
a static server-side render

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.642
for this stuff, so it's all
coming down really quickly.

00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:09.266
We're going to take
a look at your home

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:11.320
page, which does things
a little bit differently.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.140
So again, you're server-side
rendering your content.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.230
So this is like about
500, 600 milliseconds in.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.670
You've got content
on the screen.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.280
So you've got your first paint.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.000
You've got body
text here as well.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.500
Arguably, this is
first meaningful paint.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.202
But I guess it's
really down to you,

00:03:27.202 --> 00:03:29.660
because you don't have headline
text or navigation in place

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.160
just yet.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.951
MATT: Yeah, so headline
text and navigation

00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:33.600
are using a custom font.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.060
I am pretty much waiting for
the font display parameter

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.570
to land, because
basically the font

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.280
isn't important in my head.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.540
But I want it to be there.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.140
So it's one of the
things of, well,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.917
I can't manage the caching
or anything like that.

00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:48.500
I just basically want to say,
if it's cached in there, use it.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.764
If not, then don't
bother, but I can't yet.

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:52.430
ADDY: I mean, in this
case, just to keep

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.980
things super, super
clear, we could say,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.360
OK, well, this is
time to first paint.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.359
And then once you've
actually got your headlines

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.921
and everything else in, that's--

00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:00.170
MATT: That's meaningful, yeah.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.620
ADDY: In this case,
because, again, you've

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.160
got navigation and
stuff in place,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.963
the next things happening
are sort of your CSS,

00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:09.060
I guess, asynchronously being
loaded in, in your case?

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.350
MATT: Yeah, so I've got the
critical pass here as SO.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.370
The first thing will
have inline CSS.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.439
So it stops the layout from
popping in everything else.

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:17.980
But then I load all
the extra stuff--

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.790
so background images
that aren't important

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.760
or little bits of UI that are
nice to have but not critical.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.260
ADDY: Cool.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.040
So at this point, I imagine a
user could probably navigate

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.070
around your site, right?

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.570
MATT: Yeah.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.570
ADDY: So you've got stable
layout and everything

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.030
at that point.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.654
Beyond those key user
moments, and again,

00:04:35.654 --> 00:04:37.320
one you've got stable
layout, the person

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.770
should be able to like
interact with the app

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.853
or your navigation, right?

00:04:39.853 --> 00:04:40.590
MATT: Yeah.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.340
ADDY: I think was Paul
Irish that actually

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.381
enumerated some of these.

00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:48.160
So when your page feels
ready to interact with,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.790
it could be the case that
the user agent is completed

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.440
with its loading indicator.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.130
You've got your primary
text and images painted.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.730
All of your layout
has stabilized.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.270
Once all that stuff is done,
you're in a fairly good state.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.050
You could consider that there's
stuff after that that applies

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.990
to RAIL, the
performance model we've

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.010
been talking about in the past.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.352
Is it delightful?

00:05:08.352 --> 00:05:10.560
Is there anything else that
needs to load on the page

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.970
in order to enrich
that user experience?

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.560
But I think, looking at
normal speeds or cable speeds,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.860
your site's actually
doing pretty.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.050
MATT: Like, the way that I
treat a lot of this stuff

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.730
is if all you received was
the HTML and nothing else,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.872
the page should be stable,
it should be usable,

00:05:27.872 --> 00:05:29.330
and it should paint
everything that

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.140
is needed to just be usable.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.640
Because the way that
I see all of this

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.430
is if you treat that as just
like the very first thing

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.740
that you get is HTML and it
all works, everything past that

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.850
is just useful.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.670
So, yeah, that's how
I try and treat it

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.280
as much as I can, because I
feel like one way or another,

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.860
that's the fastest
I'm going to get.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.310
ADDY: So what we recommend
people to check out

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.900
their first meaningful paint
times on Dev 2's Network

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.432
Panel, Time Line.

00:06:00.432 --> 00:06:02.640
I'm going to see-- so Web
Page Test is another really

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.410
great thing to check it out on.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.730
MATT: Because you get the
filmstrip view, which is nice.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.104
ADDY: You get the
filmstrip view,

00:06:07.104 --> 00:06:09.970
which is nice, and shows
you the breakdown really

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.270
good on sites that have got like
just a lot of activity going

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.150
on.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.770
So that's worth checking out.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.730
But, yeah, it's about it
for first meaningful paint.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.200
MATT: Yeah, just see
what you're doing.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.150
