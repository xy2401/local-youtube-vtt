[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.000
SPEAKER 1: So today we're
going to talk about Lighthouse,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.700
a tool for auditing your
progressive web apps and just

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.340
your general web
apps for performance

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.334
best practices, general
web dev best practices.

00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:21.750
SPEAKER 2: I kind think of it
as like page speed insights,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.560
but the newer, more
fanciful version.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560
SPEAKER 1: It's page speed
insights on steroids.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.940
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.900
That's a good way of putting it.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.360
SPEAKER 1: But nice steroids.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.670
OK.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.360
So the first thing
that we're going to do,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.568
we're going to dive right in.

00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:34.580
Here we have a
progressive web app.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.440
And we're going to use
the Lighthouse Chrome

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.387
extension on this.

00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:38.970
So as soon as you've
got it installed,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.900
you can go and click
on the extension

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.060
and run Generate Report.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.560
Now what this is
going to do is it's

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.580
going to run through a number
of different gathering passes.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.890
I'm going to check a bunch
of different audits out.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.720
And it should hopefully generate
you a nice, cool-looking report

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.545
like that right off the bat.

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:55.170
SPEAKER 2: Yay.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.586
SPEAKER 1: Now this is useful
for a few different reasons.

00:00:57.586 --> 00:01:00.140
It'll check different
features, like do

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.800
you have support for something
meaningful when you're offline

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.410
or on flaky network connections?

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.000
Is your pagelet
performance fast?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.630
It's got nice
tracking for things

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.620
like first meaningful
paint, input latency,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.820
time to interactive.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.200
Interactivity is sort of
really important these days

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.910
because a lot of times
when we're using libraries

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.420
or frameworks to
ship apps, we're

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.630
shipping large jobs or
bundles down the line.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.680
Perhaps not chunking those
out as much as we can,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.937
meaning that you can
render something on screen.

00:01:26.937 --> 00:01:29.270
But it's not going to be
something the user can actually

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.310
interact with.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.080
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.337
And it's also got things
like it checks whether you've

00:01:33.337 --> 00:01:34.920
got a web app manifest,
whether you're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.140
defining certain
parameters in there, which

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.056
would allow people to
add a [INAUDIBLE] screen

00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:40.116
or stuff like that.

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:41.740
One of the really
nice things with this

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.104
is, as the web kind of grows and
there's new APIs being added,

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:47.520
Lighthouse is a nice way of
keeping up to date with those.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.020
Because they'll actually add
in checks for those things.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.603
And if obviously you
haven't got them,

00:01:51.603 --> 00:01:52.750
it'll highlight it for you.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.980
So this is also one
way of just making sure

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.407
that you're a good solid web
app following best practices,

00:01:57.407 --> 00:01:59.490
but also helps you stay
up to date with new things

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.160
as they land.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.951
SPEAKER 1: Exactly.

00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:03.340
So Lighthouse also
tracks best practices,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.370
checks on accessibility.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.560
But it's also possible
to write your own custom

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.030
audits for checking
your own best practices.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.780
Because your team might
have some of those

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.154
that they want to
keep an eye on.

00:02:13.154 --> 00:02:14.650
But Lighthouse is
super extensible,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.150
easy to write your own audits.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.740
Now although we've been using
it as a Chrome extension,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.870
it's totally also
available as a CLI tool.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.380
So let's go and check that out.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.201
So here I've got something I'm
going to show you a little bit

00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:27.700
later.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.730
But first we're going
to run Lighthouse

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.274
against basically the--

00:02:32.274 --> 00:02:33.190
SPEAKER 2: Canonical--

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.315
SPEAKER 1: --The canonical.

00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:34.979
SPEAKER 2: PWA.

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.020
SPEAKER 1: Airhorner.com.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.320
I think Paul Kinlan owes us
some of affiliate money for this

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.540
now.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.039
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.987
But basically we're running
this at a CLI level.

00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:42.570
It's going in.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.340
It's running the
exact same tests.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.350
You can see Chrome
running in the background.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.150
And off the bat you have this
really nicely formatted report

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.900
that has all the
same info, tells

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.602
us what are time to
interactive scores like?

00:02:55.602 --> 00:02:57.310
Do we have our service
worker registered?

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.290
Are we responding with the right
responses when we're offline?

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.460
And so on.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.462
This will also output the
report to a file locally.

00:03:04.462 --> 00:03:06.670
So you can go and you can
check that out if you want.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.870
Super duper nice.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.160
It's also possible
to use Lighthouse

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.880
as a node module in case you
want to write your own tools

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.790
on top of it.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.840
And maybe one thing
that is worth showing

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.220
is another little
tool that Paul Irish

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.790
wrote that reuses Lighthouse's
data called Progressive Web

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.822
Metrics.

00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:27.530
So we're going to do
is, I've pulled down

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.570
the latest version of that.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.670
I'm just going to go and run it.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.540
Now this is running
the exact same test.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.290
It's spinning up Chrome
in the background.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.380
But what should
output here hopefully,

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.680
if everything goes
OK, is a number

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.050
of different really nice
prettily formatted graphs that

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.327
show what does your first
meaningful paint look like,

00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:45.910
when are you visually
complete, what's

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.070
your time to interactive
score, and how long it's

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.490
been since navigation started.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.730
So you just want to
keep an eye on that.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.720
Because you don't want your
users having to wait forever

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.678
and ever and ever and
ever and ever before they

00:03:54.678 --> 00:03:56.580
can see and interact
with your experience.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.540
SPEAKER 2: So the
nice thing about this

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.373
is it is just highlighting
the fact that you

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:01.416
can pull in Lighthouse as
a node module yourself,

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:02.540
run exactly the same tests.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.290
But if there's
particular rules that you

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.920
care about or-- for
example-- maybe your team

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.937
is just working on
Service Worker support

00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:11.270
and you just want to track
offline over a period of time

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.060
or other things
around that nature,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.982
you can use Lighthouse
and just rip out

00:04:14.982 --> 00:04:16.440
the particular
rules you care about

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.320
and show it in any way
that works for you.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.320
SPEAKER 1: Yeah totally.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.529
So another thing I'm going
to show you-- so let's

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.960
open up Lighthouse really,
really quickly once again.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.418
I'm going to open
up Airhorner.com.

00:04:25.418 --> 00:04:27.480
And I'm going to use
a little flag called

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.576
Save Assets on that.

00:04:28.576 --> 00:04:29.450
So we're going to go.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.866
And we're going to do another
one of these gathering runs,

00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:33.040
collect all the data.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.400
SPEAKER 2: [SINGING NONSENSE]

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.730
SPEAKER 1: All this stuff.
[SINGING NONSENSE] OK.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.100
So it's done.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.710
And now if I open
up this directory--

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.820
I probably shouldn't have been
using that directory for it--

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.000
I can go into Chrome.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.140
I can open up a
brand-new timeline.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.050
I can go and I can
load my timeline data.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.730
I just need to pull
up my projects.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.430
Or what I can do here--
because you know surely

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.610
Chrome supports this--
I can go over to here

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.614
and drag this into Timeline.

00:04:57.614 --> 00:04:58.280
Oh it's so good.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.285
It just works.

00:04:59.285 --> 00:04:59.640
SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.070
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.236
So what you can see here
is that the trace generated

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:04.160
by Lighthouse is totally
openable by Timeline

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
in case you want to go
and inspect this further.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.070
Super duper nice.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.390
Lighthouse can also be used
as sort of a post-processor

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.930
for any of your traces.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.994
So super useful for making
the best use of this data.

00:05:14.994 --> 00:05:15.660
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.799
The thing I like about
this, if you've got a CI,

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:19.590
you might want to save
some of these assets

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.506
over a period of time.

00:05:20.506 --> 00:05:22.880
So if anything does happen
or start going wrong,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.088
you've actually got the
traces to go with it as well.

00:05:25.088 --> 00:05:27.150
So you can start
debug straight away.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.670
Airhorner is doing amazingly
looking at this timeline.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.253
Just because there's
basically nothing

00:05:31.253 --> 00:05:32.694
in the app other
than one button.

00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:33.360
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.555
Which surprisingly has
had a number of bugs

00:05:35.555 --> 00:05:36.680
over a long period of time.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.830
SPEAKER 1: What are
you talking about it?

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.610
It just does one thing.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.110
It's great.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.360
So we talked about using
Lighthouse as a node module.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.710
But we've been
talking also lately

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.970
about the importance of
testing on real-world devices,

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.110
focusing on
interactivity, focusing

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.810
on network connections like
3G where that's probably

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.750
what people are using
out there in the wild.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.852
Matt is going to
show you what this

00:05:56.852 --> 00:05:59.060
looks like on a real device
when you're trying it out

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.480
with Lighthouse.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.840
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.330
So if you go to
Lighthouse Read Me,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.940
there's a small section like
Lighthouse with Mobile Devices.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.920
And the really important
command is this ADB Forward TCP.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.220
Basically all that's doing
when you run it is it

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.690
opens up a socket between
your device and your laptop.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.680
So once I've done
that, I can just

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.540
go ahead and run Lighthouse
with Dash Dash Mobile.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.100
And once I run that, I'm just
going to stick it on my site.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.225
You're going to start seeing
exactly the same thing

00:06:23.225 --> 00:06:26.320
as you've seen on desktop
where the website is reloading.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.085
It's doing all of its auditing.

00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:31.400
We've got the CLI
going crazy, pulling

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.030
in random bits of information.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.690
But at the end, we end
up with the same report

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.837
as we saw from
[? ADI ?] before in CLI

00:06:37.837 --> 00:06:39.670
that you also get from
the Chrome extension.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.760
So we start seeing scores.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.730
I'm not doing great
in some aspects.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.406
But others are fine.

00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:46.031
But yeah.

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:46.830
It's super handy.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.820
Because it means if
the device is on 3G,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.090
the test will actually
be running on 3G.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.436
And if you got a slow device,
if anything like this scrolling

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:57.060
test I think they're
looking at, that's

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.950
probably going to be
affected by the performance

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.116
of the actual device itself.

00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:02.730
So you can start
getting regular testing

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:03.772
of these kind of aspects.

00:07:03.772 --> 00:07:04.438
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:07:04.438 --> 00:07:06.260
So Matt's not doing
great in some aspects,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.390
because his Lighthouse scores
are also all over the place.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.080
And on that note, Case just
released a brand-new guide

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.800
on Auditing Web
Apps with Lighthouse

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.781
over on developers.google.com.

00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:19.260
Please feel free
to check it out.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.073
It's using the canonical--

00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:21.980
SPEAKER 2: Airhorner.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.861
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:23.736
SPEAKER 1: Of course.

00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:24.700
Go check that out.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.036
Try out Lighthouse.

00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:27.160
Let us know what you think.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.785
If you have any
feedback at all, please

00:07:28.785 --> 00:07:30.460
feel free to file issues.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.210
But yeah.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.084
That was Lighthouse.

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:32.750
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.560
Check out the links
in the description.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.460
SPEAKER 1: Bye.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.110
