00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.140
ADDY OSMANI: Here we are back
in our natural environment

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.400
next to lifeless
barges and wildlife

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.460
that probably hates us.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.834
MATT GAUNT: But it's stopped
raining, so we're all right.

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:21.470
Look on the plus side.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.120
ADDY OSMANI: The two winged
gods are being kind today.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.520
So DevTools, people have
wanted a [? dog ?] theme

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.761
built in for quite some time.

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.760
MATT GAUNT: No you've
wanted the [? dog ?] theme

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.361
so people can ask you, what
DevTool's theme is Addy using?

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:36.860
ADDY OSMANI: Let's picture a
world where that might be true.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.150
Now if you went to
Settings, you could actually

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.670
enable such a beautiful
theme under Appearance.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.270
So let's go try that
out and see if it works.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.420
So what that'll do
is it'll instantly

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.890
re-theme all of DevTools
and device mode,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.987
as with the build that
we're using today.

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:55.570
So you can go, and you can check
out all the different panels.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.220
We can try out recording
timeline stuff, just

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.815
to see how well this
looks on different panes.

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:02.790
So here we can see
timeline looks great.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.209
You can do all your screen
shot stuff, looks good.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.885
Resources, sources
panel, network, profiles,

00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:09.260
all this stuff
has been optimized

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.790
to look really good
with this theme.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.664
So it's kind of neat.

00:01:11.664 --> 00:01:14.097
People should
maybe check it out.

00:01:14.097 --> 00:01:15.680
MATT GAUNT: So one
of the other things

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.390
that's recently been
added to DevTools

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.720
is the security panel,
which is much more exciting.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.490
ADDY OSMANI: Questionably
more exciting.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.770
MATT GAUNT: More important.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.677
ADDY OSMANI: Questionably
more important.

00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:28.010
MATT GAUNT: So basically what
the security panel will do

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.005
is if you've got
[? HBS ?] for your site,

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:32.970
and everything's fine, there's
literally no reason you really

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.530
need to go here, because for the
most part, you should be fine.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.180
But if you've got
something wrong

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.540
with your site, like this one,
where it served the [? HBS, ?]

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.640
but it's not the red padlock
or the green padlock.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.054
It's the usual piece of paper.

00:01:46.054 --> 00:01:47.970
The security panel will
actually tell you why.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.511
So in this case it's
saying, the page

00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:51.678
isn't secure, because it's
using a SHA1 certificate.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.094
ADDY OSMANI: Just
to double check,

00:01:53.094 --> 00:01:54.400
you're not on AddyOsmani.com?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.361
MATT GAUNT: No, I
think you're OK.

00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:58.110
I couldn't use your
site as a bad example,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.440
despite my attempt.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.620
But it's also helpful for things
like you've got mixed content.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.702
So in this case, we've got
one blocked mixed content.

00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:08.910
And in this case, you can
click on the network panel,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.250
and it takes you to
that one resource.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.937
So it's a JavaScript
file that's been blocked.

00:02:14.937 --> 00:02:17.270
But it's just basically a
super clean and super nice way

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.420
of debugging half the problems,
and it's really useful

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.450
if you find that Chrome's
doing something weird.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.680
And you don't really understand
why it's doing what it's doing.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.530
That's the place to go.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.670
ADDY OSMANI: That's cool.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.340
So do you know the
way that on your site,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.630
your site looks really pretty?

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.960
I'm kind of jealous, because
your site looks better

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.940
than mine now.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.270
But on your site, you've
got a mix of system fonts,

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.050
like that people
probably have installed,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.550
and web fonts that you might
be learning from Google

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.070
Fonts or somewhere else.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.425
But if you take a look--

00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:46.560
[GEESE HONKING]

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.940
The wildlife just loves us here.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.920
They're just super stoked
about what I'm going to show.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.346
So here what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.920
going to go and check
out the DOM tree view

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.850
and select some text.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.404
So here I'm going
to just zoom in.

00:02:58.404 --> 00:03:00.820
Installs-- you can see that
we've got this new little side

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.620
panel called Rendered Fonts.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.120
And what this will
let you do is see

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.661
if a font that's
currently being used

00:03:05.661 --> 00:03:07.730
for a particular
piece of UI is local,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.372
meaning it's a system
font, or if it's

00:03:09.372 --> 00:03:10.580
been loaded over the network.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.370
So that's a system font.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.130
Here we've got some
other text you've got.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.250
You've been testing a service
worker heading or something.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.455
Title block content,
you with your BEM.

00:03:22.455 --> 00:03:24.305
MATT GAUNT: I try.

00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:25.180
ADDY OSMANI: You try.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.638
And here we can
see if this one has

00:03:26.638 --> 00:03:28.050
been loaded over the network.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.490
So it's just a
nice little tidbit.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.130
MATT GAUNT: I used to use a
Chrome extension of WhatFont

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.100
for just exactly this, because
especially if you wanted

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.440
a font to load, and
you want to figure out

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.910
was it the one that I specified?

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.910
Was it the fullback?

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.490
Super nice.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.740
I love it.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.710
ADDY OSMANI: So you've
got that built in now.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.520
Another thing I wanted
to show-- so here we've

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.899
got getbootstrap.com.

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.190
Everyone is familiar with this.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.919
Half the web is built with
this thing at this point.

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.710
And I'm just going to
select a piece of UI.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.810
So I've selected the
Download Bootstrap button.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.860
Now over in Styles, if you
take a look-- let's zoom in.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.890
You've got a new .cls button,
and that's basically element

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.830
classes.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.440
So what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to click on that.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.550
And what this button has
done is it's actually

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.050
gone and plucked out all
the different class names

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.672
that I have for this domino.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.640
And this just lets me
go and toggle on and off

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.470
different classes.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.730
So here you can see that I'm
able to turn this thing off

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.325
from looking like a button.

00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:25.950
And this type of
thing is really useful

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.465
if you're dealing with
state of any kind,

00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:29.280
and you just want to
iterate and play around

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.446
with your different classes.

00:04:30.446 --> 00:04:32.240
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, the
nice thing with this

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.240
is I normally end up just
unchecking all the styles

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.770
for a particular class rather
than just do what you've done,

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.130
which is disable
the entire class.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.338
So again, that's really nice.

00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:41.232
I like it.

00:04:41.232 --> 00:04:42.440
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.597
So another thing--

00:04:43.597 --> 00:04:44.680
MATT GAUNT: Another thing?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.805
ADDY OSMANI: Another thing.

00:04:45.805 --> 00:04:48.310
Yeah, this is how I get kicked
off stages at conferences.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.580
Another thing, it's not good.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.250
This is Paul Lewis'
voice memos app.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.570
I've currently got the
DevTools color picker open.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.246
And if you hold over any
color in the color palette

00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:00.870
now, what you'll see
is we actually now

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.280
show you a whole range
of different tints

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.880
for those colors,
which is kind of neat.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.574
So you can see lighter
versions and darker versions

00:05:11.574 --> 00:05:12.740
of any of those colors here.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.700
I'm just going to
go and select some.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.890
This is kind of nice.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.082
We actually now show titles
that hint at alternative shades.

00:05:20.082 --> 00:05:22.040
So this just shows you
all the different shades

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.289
available for a particular
color that you've selected.

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:25.040
It's kind of nice.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.206
Avoids you having to go
back out to yet another Tool

00:05:27.206 --> 00:05:28.401
to check it out.

00:05:28.401 --> 00:05:30.067
MATT GAUNT: I'm still
trying to find it.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.760
ADDY OSMANI: You'll
find it sometime.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.310
