[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.860
MATT: PageSpeed Insights--
it's a great tool just

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.360
for performance,
because it's, like,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.934
desktop speed, mobile
speed, and UX, as well.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:15.600
ADDY: The UX side is
really interesting,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.340
because you take the tool-- you
take a site like Hacker News,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.070
for example.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.860
Try to look at it on
mobile, try to put it

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.800
through PageSpeed Insights.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.883
And what you'll notice is
that the UX scores there

00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:28.510
will actually show you images
showing where they can improve.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.940
So they've got really small
touch targets, for example.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.440
MATT: Yeah.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.106
ADDY: Meaning that,
if you go on a phone

00:00:33.106 --> 00:00:35.840
and you try navigating
around that, you're hosed.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.206
So they could probably
fix that, maybe?

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:40.110
MATT: Yeah.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.830
ADDY: Something we
also recently added

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.530
to PageSpeed Insights was the
ability to just go and download

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.917
optimized images and optimized
CSS and other resources.

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:48.750
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.240
MATT: [INAUDIBLE], yeah.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.660
ADDY: It was like a
subtle little link

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.910
underneath all of the scores
you can go and check out.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.734
I would say you're going to
get a different pack of stuff

00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:57.650
depending on whether
you're in the mobile view

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.051
or the desktop view.

00:00:59.051 --> 00:00:59.550
MATT: Eh.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.670
ADDY: But it's
worth checking out,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.169
even if you don't use them,
just to see what kind of savings

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.784
you could get.

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:06.200
MATT: It's interesting to see
it, but the other side of it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.215
as well is you kind of
want it in a build process.

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:08.437
ADDY: Right.

00:01:08.437 --> 00:01:08.550
Right.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.500
MATT: Because the minute
you change anything,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.124
you don't want to have to, then,
run through PageSpeed Insights

00:01:13.124 --> 00:01:14.970
to then get the downloaded
stuff, and, yeah.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.847
And obviously I ended
up doing a video

00:01:17.847 --> 00:01:20.180
on PageSpeed Insights for
last year's I/O, so, you know,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.750
there's that.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.560
ADDY: It's almost
an upsell-- that.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.060
MATT: No.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.610
ADDY: No.
