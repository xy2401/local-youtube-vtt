[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.540
ADDY OSMANI: So welcome
to Totally Tooling Tips.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.200
This is an episode
on DevTools, where

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.710
we're going to talk about our
newer, progressive Web App

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.332
tooling.

00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:15.040
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.210
So the reason we have to do this
is we record an entire video

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.110
episode and then
everything changed.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.690
ADDY OSMANI: It's Tuesday,
so DevTools has changed.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.190
Right.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.960
So the resources
panel has now been

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.400
replaced by the shiny,
new application panel.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.669
So I'm currently on
Progressive Web App.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:32.710
This is smaller pictures.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.200
And some of the newer stuff
that we let you preview

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.982
include your Web App Manifest.

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:39.690
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.080
So basically, Web App
Manifest is kind of,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.250
if you've ever built
Web Apps or you've

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.350
had to do icons for different
devices and browsers,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.120
and you had to put
in lots of link tags,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.920
Manifest is a JSON
file where you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.504
can put all of that stuff
in one separate resource.

00:00:55.504 --> 00:00:57.920
And the browser will only go
and grab it when it needs it.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.170
ADDY OSMANI: Yep.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.867
So we summarize everything from
your name, your short name,

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:03.200
through the different theme
colors and background colors

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.140
that you're using.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.430
We show you your orientation
chosen in your manifest file,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.940
and then just preview all
the different icon sizes

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.940
you might have set up.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.647
So I've got all of
them because I'm crazy.

00:01:13.647 --> 00:01:14.730
MATT GAUNT: You are crazy.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.730
ADDY OSMANI: I am crazy.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.960
It also lets you emulate
as the home screen,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.310
if you click on this
little link here.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.930
That's just like the experience
where it'll show you, OK, well

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.780
what do you wanna
name this thing?

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.470
MATT GAUNT: So
the reason this is

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.620
important is because whenever
you click on Add to Home

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.661
Screen, what it will do
is it will go through all

00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:33.640
of the criteria that Chrome
looks for to basically decide

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.890
whether it's going to show
the user the banner or not.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.724
So it'll be things
like, does the Web App

00:01:37.724 --> 00:01:38.640
have a Service Worker?

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.760
Does it have a short name?

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.930
Does it have a theme color?

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.630
And if any of those
criteria aren't

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.170
met, it will print out
an error to the console,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.120
just saying, yeah,
you need to have this.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.730
And because it's not there, I
can't do Add to Home Screen.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.480
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.510
So the next thing we're
going to take a look at

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.930
is the Service Worker panel.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.640
So debugging Service Worker
has been historically

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.660
really, really painful.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.950
And I think DevTools has
nicely evolved over time

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.202
to make that experience
a little bit sweeter.

00:02:04.202 --> 00:02:04.910
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.910
This is definitely the
best version of it.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.210
It's just really hard,
when you're starting out,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.920
to understand what is
going on when you're doing

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.880
this stuff for the first time.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.276
But I think it's definitely
the nicest version so far.

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:18.400
ADDY OSMANI: So we're going
to quickly walk through

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.275
all the options here.

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:21.430
So the first one is
an offline check box.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.230
And basically, if we
go and we refresh,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.040
you'll see that the
app is working offline.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.040
This just emulates
offline in the same way

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.460
that the network throttling
drop down will let you do.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.169
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.751
ADDY OSMANI: Fairly useful when
you're testing offline support

00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:34.670
with Service Worker.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.370
The next option is
Update on Reload,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.280
which forces your Service Worker
script to update on refresh.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.010
MATT GAUNT: So
the reason this is

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.390
super handy is before this
existed, what you'd have to do

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.890
is you'd make an edit to your
Service Worker, you'd save it,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.492
you'd go back into your
browser, you'd refresh.

00:02:51.492 --> 00:02:52.950
And once you've
refreshed the page,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.600
it will still be
using the old Service

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.650
Worker because your new
Service Worker will be grabbed

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.580
by the browser, it will go
through an install step,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.130
and the new Service Worker
can't take over the page

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.730
until the old one is gone.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.500
So when you check update
on reload, what it's doing

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.020
is it will unregister
the old Service Worker,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.670
register the new one, and once
the new one's ready to go,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.460
it'll refresh the
page so then the page

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.410
is using the new Service Worker.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.609
So it's one
checkbox, but there's

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.650
kind of a lot of stuff
going on behind the scenes

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.407
and it's super useful.

00:03:22.407 --> 00:03:23.990
ADDY OSMANI: Next
up, we've got Bypass

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.365
for Network, which will bypass
your Service Worker script

00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:28.290
and load resources
from the network.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.790
MATT GAUNT: The
reason this is handy

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.840
is when you're not working
on a Service Worker

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.330
and you're working
on other files,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.615
you don't want anything to
be pulled from the cache.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.156
You just want to be using the
files that you've just changed.

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:39.130
ADDY OSMANI: Yep.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.380
Then we've got Show All.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.770
And Show All will basically
show you every single Service

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.327
Worker that's registered.

00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:46.660
Because we've got an increasing
number of sites and apps

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.220
using this, you might find
this a little bit noisy.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.500
MATT GAUNT: I'd just say, you're
very unlikely to ever want

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.690
this, until something like
foreign Service Workers

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.260
come in.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.490
ADDY OSMANI: We're just letting
you know that it exists today.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.940
Unless they change it tomorrow.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.079
But it's here, today, at least.

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.370
What else does this let you do?

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.870
OK.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.800
So you can update
your Service Worker.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.740
There's a Push option as well.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.490
What does that do?

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.900
Let's head over to your demo.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.400
MATT GAUNT: I'm going to guess
it's going to do something

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.550
with push messages.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.291
ADDY OSMANI: You're
so bright, Matthew.

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:17.790
Right.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.834
So this is a push demo
Matt wrote a while back.

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:21.209
We're going to go
and we're going

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.250
to enable push notifications.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.410
Your demo worked this time.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.210
MATT GAUNT: Yes!

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.001
ADDY OSMANI: Right.

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.962
So what we're going to
do is, if we click Push,

00:04:28.962 --> 00:04:30.420
it's going to
emulate a push event.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.640
And you'll see that we
get a push notification.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.431
MATT GAUNT: And this
is kind of interesting

00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:38.320
because this is the first time
I've actually seen or tested

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.417
this myself in Canary.

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:41.000
And they basically
added a new feature

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.160
where it's populating a little
bit of data in there, which

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.950
is kind of super interesting,
slightly weird with the fact

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.819
that you can't determine
what the data is,

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.610
but it's awesome that
it's there because it

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.026
does mean that if you wanted
to check what data would look

00:04:55.026 --> 00:04:57.247
like when it comes in
your Service Worker,

00:04:57.247 --> 00:04:58.580
it's now something that's there.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.940
It's awesome.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.731
ADDY OSMANI: Sweet.

00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:01.950
And what happens if we
click Send a Push via XHR?

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.190
Does anything happen?

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.317
MATT GAUNT: It should do.

00:05:04.317 --> 00:05:05.400
ADDY OSMANI: It should do.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.960
Doesn't actually-- oh, I didn't.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.515
There we go.

00:05:08.515 --> 00:05:09.640
MATT GAUNT: Oh no, you did.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.490
GCM just took a
while to kick in.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.110
So there, because
there's no data,

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.747
it's just like a
super generic, thanks

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:15.788
for sending this message.

00:05:15.788 --> 00:05:17.420
ADDY OSMANI: Sweet.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.080
You can also go and
click on the little name.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.954
Oh, you got a minified
Service Worker.

00:05:23.954 --> 00:05:24.870
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, man.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.369
ADDY OSMANI: What
do you-- OK, let's

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:28.115
go to someone who
hasn't done that.

00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:29.820
And if we click on
Source, you can go

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.194
and you can check out the
source to your Service Workers.

00:05:32.194 --> 00:05:35.500
MATT GAUNT: He just doesn't
care about user's data.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.437
So the reason this is
actually super cool

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:39.270
is the fact that you
can now add breakpoints

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.400
to your Service Worker, like
you would any normal JavaScript

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.900
file.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.800
So when that code gets
executed in the Service Worker,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.065
it will actually stop the
Service Worker from running

00:05:47.065 --> 00:05:49.190
and you can start debugging
stuff like you normally

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.023
would with DevTools.

00:05:50.023 --> 00:05:50.750
Which is nice.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.910
ADDY OSMANI: Sweet.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.110
So you can see that
we've got these activity

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.200
indicators for the Status.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.570
So green means that something
is active and it's running.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.130
You can stop your Service
Workers, we can go and do that.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.700
It'll say Activate and Stopped.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.254
Or you can focus your client--
so we're currently focused.

00:06:06.254 --> 00:06:07.920
And also hit Details
and it'll show you,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.610
in line, any of the
exceptions or error messages

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.456
you've been getting.

00:06:11.456 --> 00:06:12.830
MATT GAUNT: So
the one thing that

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.982
used to exist here
that's been removed

00:06:14.982 --> 00:06:17.191
is you used to be able to
have like an Inspect button

00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:18.565
that you would
click and it would

00:06:18.565 --> 00:06:20.540
open up an entirely
different DevTools just

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.960
for Service Worker.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.650
I still kind of like having the
two DevTools, one for the page,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.190
one for Service
Worker, but I think

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.380
the DevTools team are
trying to get everyone

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.270
to work just out
of the one DevTools

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.780
and change different context.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.910
So in this case, all
the Service Worker logs

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.600
will show up in the one console,
and you select different frames

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.430
within that.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.270
So it's kind of interesting.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.330
It's the only thing that
I'm anxious about, I guess.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.630
But this is quite a nice way
of at least servicing just

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.131
the errors.

00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:48.588
ADDY OSMANI: Because I'm ADD,
I'm just going to click clear

00:06:48.588 --> 00:06:50.300
and now all of our
problems have gone.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.720
MATT GAUNT: If only
life was that simple.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.470
ADDY OSMANI: If only
life was that simple.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.320
Clear storage is basically
the best thing ever.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.254
If you're developing any
non-trivial progressive Web App

00:06:59.254 --> 00:07:01.670
and you're trying to support
offline with Service Workers,

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.120
you're maybe using
a storage mechanism

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.590
like IndexedDB, a local
storage or session storage,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.670
you've probably run
into the situation where

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.700
you need to manually
go in and clear

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.600
all of your different
storage mechanisms out,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.975
and then head to
different panels

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.230
to unregister Service Workers.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.252
And it's just-- it's this
whole super tedious thing.

00:07:18.252 --> 00:07:18.960
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.680
I've ended up writing
helper scripts

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.110
that I just drop into the
console to delete everything.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.610
Yeah.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.318
It's annoying when
you get to that point.

00:07:26.318 --> 00:07:28.940
ADDY OSMANI: So in an effort
to make Matt Gaunt redundant,

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.700
there's now a clear site--

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.040
MATT GAUNT: Well, that
escalated quickly.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.160
ADDY OSMANI: There's now
a Clear Site Data button.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.470
I think the label for
this might be changing.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.690
The button is still there.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.510
Basically, what this
does is it almost

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.020
resets the world for you,
which is kind of really nice.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.580
It does all the
things it says above,

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.730
like it will
unregister your Service

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.979
Workers and your storage,
and clear out your cache API

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:49.739
storage.

00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:52.280
MATT GAUNT: And yeah, this does
seem like an obvious feature,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.880
but at the same time it hasn't
existed for the longest time.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.880
And when you start working
with Service Workers,

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.500
you realize how quickly
you just get into a mess

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.246
and you just want
to reset everything.

00:08:02.246 --> 00:08:03.620
And the old solution
for that was

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.850
to just develop in
Incognito Windows,

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.660
so this is super welcome.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.430
ADDY OSMANI: This is so nice.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.590
We were talking
about cache storage.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.832
Because this was
Resources Panel,

00:08:14.832 --> 00:08:17.290
you can still go in and debug
all of your different storage

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:17.920
mechanisms.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.000
That includes the cache API.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.944
So in the case of my app,
I'm using sw-precache.

00:08:22.944 --> 00:08:24.110
So I have all these entries.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.181
For someone like Paul Lewis's
voice memos app, we go in here

00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:30.180
and you'll just see that
there's an entry that's

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.980
got all the different
files listed that he's

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.480
got cached in the cache API.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.860
MATT GAUNT: I wonder why
the response is empty?

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.860
ADDY OSMANI: Shh.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.360
It's all perfect.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.169
It's all perfectly perfect.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.559
And you've also got other
options in here, like frames.

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:46.350
MATT GAUNT: Don't just
say that like it is.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.870
No one knows what frames is.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.911
ADDY OSMANI: I don't know
what this does anymore.

00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:52.080
It's basically a breakdown
of different things.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.400
MATT GAUNT: It's
just like a list

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.540
of assets that are downloaded.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.789
ADDY OSMANI: Different assets.

00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:57.389
Let's assume that it does that.

00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:59.680
Maybe this gives us something
to do another episode on.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.520
MATT GAUNT: Next week on
Totally Tooling Mini Tips.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.332
What is frames under
Applications tab?

00:09:04.332 --> 00:09:05.290
ADDY OSMANI: All right.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.800
So I feel enlightened.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.452
That is the Application tab.

00:09:09.452 --> 00:09:10.910
Is there anything
we're forgetting?

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.370
MATT GAUNT: You've got device
art on the screenshot there.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.106
ADDY OSMANI: I've
got device art.

00:09:15.106 --> 00:09:19.074
So Canary DevTools now let's
you like preview device art

00:09:19.074 --> 00:09:20.240
for a few different devices.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.880
So we've got the
Nexus 5x in there,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.610
I think the six might
also have device art?

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.180
It does not.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.096
It does in the very, very
latest version, I think.

00:09:28.096 --> 00:09:29.220
MATT GAUNT: So it's coming.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:29.850
ADDY OSMANI: It's coming.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.391
But basically, device
art is awesome.

00:09:31.391 --> 00:09:33.310
Just lets you see
what it would maybe

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.030
look like on an actual device.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.210
MATT GAUNT: And it
adds in the navigation

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.130
bar at the top and other
stuff, so it's nice.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.370
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah,
you can go in here

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.520
and get your little
navigation bar in.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.070
I have asked for us to take
theme color into account.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.054
MATT GAUNT: Oh yeah.

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:49.345
ADDY OSMANI: You could do that.

00:09:49.345 --> 00:09:50.180
MATT GAUNT: That
would be really nice.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.470
And then it would-- yeah.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.920
ADDY OSMANI: Assume that, by
the time you've seen this,

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.650
maybe we've convinced them and
this is already out of date.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:56.700
MATT GAUNT: And if
not, raise issues.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.783
ADDY OSMANI: Raise issues.

00:09:57.783 --> 00:09:59.362
MATT GAUNT: And
maybe we can get it.

00:09:59.362 --> 00:10:00.320
ADDY OSMANI: All right.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.455
So that is the Application tab.

00:10:03.455 --> 00:10:05.330
Hopefully you'll find
that a lot of the stuff

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.890
makes it a lot easier to develop
and debug your progressive Web

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:09.490
Apps.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.575
That's it from us.

00:10:10.575 --> 00:10:11.950
MATT GAUNT: Thanks
for listening.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:12.658
ADDY OSMANI: Bye.

00:10:12.658 --> 00:10:15.600
