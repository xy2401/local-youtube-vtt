ADDY OSMANI: Hey, folks.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.040
Welcome to "Totally Tooling
Tips," season three.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.290
MATT GAUNT: Come check us out.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.290
We're going to be talking about
progressive web apps, some

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.435
of the tooling around them.

00:00:07.435 --> 00:00:11.780
ADDY OSMANI: On first visit,
we've got a relatively fast

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.130
time-to-first-meaningful paint,
module bundling, accessibility.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.830
Do you know what
the top four things

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.444
to look at when it comes
to web accessibility are?

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:22.110
MATT GAUNT: No, I can
only think of two.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.480
I only think of audio
and then visual.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.340
ADDY OSMANI: So there's
visual, hearing, mobility,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.161
and cognition.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.660
MATT GAUNT: The first episode
will be out on April the 27th.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.482
So subscribe to YouTube channel,
check out season one and two

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:35.940
before season three starts,
which should be happening soon.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.731
ADDY OSMANI: We promise
that season three's

00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:40.690
going to be equally as mediocre
as seasons one and two.
