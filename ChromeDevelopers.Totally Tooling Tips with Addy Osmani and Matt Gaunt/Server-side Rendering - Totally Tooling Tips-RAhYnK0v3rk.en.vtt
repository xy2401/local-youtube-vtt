00:00:09.504 --> 00:00:10.920
ADDY: A topic
that's come up a lot

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.840
recently is
server-side rendering.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.570
MATT: Yeah.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.340
ADDY: And it's a hot topic.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.610
MATT: Hot topic.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.450
ADDY: Hot topic.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.262
Lots of nuance, lots
of opinions around it.

00:00:18.262 --> 00:00:19.830
MATT: Yeah, lots of feelings.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.960
ADDY: What is
server-side rendering?

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.060
MATT: In a nutshell,
server-side rendering is--

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.476
and this is
particularly important

00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:29.460
for JavaScript-heavy
client side apps.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.872
You take your application,
and you think of it

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:34.632
almost like you pre-boot
it up on the server.

00:00:34.632 --> 00:00:36.090
So you stamp out
all the dom nodes.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.800
You get everything
kind of in place.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.322
You have your CSS in place
so it paints really fast.

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:42.030
And you send all that
down to the client,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.070
and you get a really
nice, fast first paint

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.445
because everything is just
already there in the document.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.145
ADDY: Right, but it
comes with a cost.

00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:48.750
MATT: Indeed.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750
ADDY: If you're server-side
rendering something,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.190
it's going to potentially
improve a few metrics,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.950
like potentially first paint,
first meaningful paint,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.260
first contentful paint,
how quickly people

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.060
get text on the screen.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.670
But it also comes at the
cost of you shipping down

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.372
a much larger payload of
HTML to know your users.

00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:07.080
MATT: Absolutely.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.640
ADDY: And that can
have the impact

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.270
of pushing out everything else,
including your JavaScript.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.606
So you get this really
fast first paint

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:16.230
showing people
something on the screen.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.290
MATT: You can see it.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.870
ADDY: You can see it, but
then you can't necessarily

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.590
interact with it.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.640
It's like you end up
on a shopping page.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.340
It renders really
quickly, and then you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.050
start tapping on buttons.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.930
And unless everything is
end-to-end server-side

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.955
rendered, the user
might have bits

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:33.000
of the experience that are not
necessarily complete or ready.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.380
So it's a trade-off.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.560
MATT: And I've
experienced this recently.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.180
I was driving through
the woods and was

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.870
on a way slower mobile
connection than I usually am.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.420
And yeah, I landed
on a page, and I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.910
knew it was server-rendered
because I was like,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.015
I can't click on any of
this, and I knew exactly why.

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:52.794
And it can be frustrating.

00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:53.460
ADDY: It can be.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.850
I mean, for different
verticals, maybe

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.337
server-side rendering
makes sense.

00:01:58.337 --> 00:01:58.920
MATT: Totally.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.794
ADDY: If I'm a publisher,
I might care more--

00:02:00.794 --> 00:02:03.570
really heavily about making
sure the article text

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.627
can be seen pretty
early on, but people

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:08.960
use server-side rendering for
lots of different reasons.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.305
So some people use it to
optimize those metrics.

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:12.930
Other people will do
it because they're

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.450
trying to make sure that
Googlebot and search

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.100
crawlers can see their content.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.240
MATT: Especially because not
all crawlers can run JavaScript.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.860
ADDY: So we've said--

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.490
Google has said that the crawler
can understand JavaScript

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.000
to some extent, and that's
great and everything.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.820
What I recommend,
if folks are unsure,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.445
is to go check out
the Webmaster Tools.

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:36.278
There's a little tool
there that let's you--

00:02:36.278 --> 00:02:37.260
MATT: Fetches Google.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.468
ADDY: Fetches Google-- that
lets you render your page

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:41.970
the same way that the
Googlebot would, and we now

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.100
know that that's
powered by Chrome 41.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.390
MATT: Chrome 41.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.860
ADDY: We got some
docs on that now.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.818
MATT: We can leave them
down in the show notes.

00:02:48.818 --> 00:02:52.061
ADDY: We'll link them
up in the magic boxes.

00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:54.060
And that's great, but you
should check that out.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.200
See if it's actually
busted in any way before--

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.647
MATT: It can be surprising
because you're like, oh, it

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.480
runs JavaScript, so I'm
just going to assume

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.520
it runs latest JavaScript.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.410
And that is not always the case.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.910
ADDY: No.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.520
Chrome 41 came out a while back.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.353
MATT: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:09.353 --> 00:03:12.155
It's probably old enough
to drive at this point.

00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:13.530
ADDY: And so there
are definitely

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.950
times when I forget to include
polyfills for search crawlers.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.860
Like you sometimes
need to-- you can

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.610
polyfill things like promises
depending on the crawler.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.434
So people should
just be careful.

00:03:27.434 --> 00:03:29.100
MATT: I think, actually,
in the article,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.520
you mention there are
even some debugging tips

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.980
because you do Fetches
Google, and you might just

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.750
see a blank page.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.525
And it's hard to know then,
OK, well, what's missing?

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:42.900
Is my application actually
broken, or like you're saying,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.520
am I missing a polyfill?

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.050
So there are some
tips in there how

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.344
you can kind of debug that
and figure out which is it.

00:03:48.344 --> 00:03:50.010
I've totally been
bitten by this before.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.292
I was missing a web
animations polyfill once.

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:54.500
And I was just like, I guess
this whole thing is just

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.035
broken.

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:56.160
And I was able to debug it.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.535
And I was like, oh, I just
need to include this one file.

00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:02.010
ADDY: So it may not be
quite as complex and broken

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.230
as folks think.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.190
There are some possible ideals.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.250
I know that, when some
people are thinking

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.370
about building mobile
websites, progressive web apps,

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.050
we'll tell them that the
architecture pattern of choice

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.399
is the application shell because
you can easily cache pieces

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.079
of your UI that don't
need to be fetched

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.610
from the network
on repeat visits.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.394
It improves your
performance, and so on.

00:04:23.394 --> 00:04:24.810
But then they're
like, well, yeah,

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.184
but I kind of need
to server-side

00:04:26.184 --> 00:04:29.460
render my content, too,
because I've A/B tested,

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.950
and server-side rendering
is improving my SEO,

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.020
and it starts to get a
little bit complicated.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.000
I mean, one possible
balance you could

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.510
find there is use your
architecture of choice--

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.750
your performance architecture
of choice for your normal users,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.320
and then conditionally serve
the server-side rendered version

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.520
to Googlebot or other
search crawlers.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.380
MATT: Do a little
UA sniffing maybe?

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.380
ADDY: I didn't say that.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.290
MATT: I didn't say that.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.355
Well, actually, I did say that.

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:55.021
ADDY: That's OK.

00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:55.930
Matt said that.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.280
MATT: Matt said that.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.550
ADDY: Matt said it.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.300
MATT: There we go.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.383
ADDY: So folks should be--

00:04:58.383 --> 00:05:00.076
there's a lot of
nuance to this problem.

00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:02.200
We're not talking about it
in terms of performance.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.000
I know that everyone is going to
have different things that they

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.600
care about.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.260
Just take a holistic look
at server-side rendering

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.520
and where there are trade-offs,
where maybe just using it

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.270
for SEO over other things
might make sense, and just

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.640
use your tools.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.140
Measure.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.880
MATT: Exactly.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.650
Tools, not rules.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.930
ADDY: Tools, not rules.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.956
MATT: That's what
the smart kids say.

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:25.609
ADDY: Is there a
sign-off of some sort

00:05:25.609 --> 00:05:26.650
you had for this episode?

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.930
MATT: It's totally time for
the end of the episode now.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.760
Thanks for watching
"Totally Tooling Tips."
