00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:18.180
ADDY OSMANI: Probably
the thing that I

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.220
use shortcuts for the most
is in my editor like Sublime.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.970
MATT GAUNT: This is
one of the nice things

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.053
that I've been realizing
between Sublime and Atom,

00:00:25.053 --> 00:00:26.890
and I think one of
the main reasons I

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.320
keep on switching
between the two

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.360
is some of the shortcuts
are exactly the same.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.600
Like the shortcut where you
just command or control,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.060
you click on a few
different lines

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.300
and then you get the
multiple cursors.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.110
And then anything you do
or type is just duplicated

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.040
across all of those lines.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.759
It's super simple,
super nice, and it's

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:46.800
exactly the same in both.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.591
ADDY OSMANI: Did you
know that because-- so

00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:51.230
a lot of in-browser
developer tools

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.120
use CodeMirror for their
editor, and because it now

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.870
supports Sublime text
shortcuts-- in lot of cases--

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.310
you can use command click in--
I believe it's Chrome DevTools,

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.020
Firefox DevTools.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.423
And I haven't checked
IE, but eh, maybe?

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:04.339
MATT GAUNT: Hopefully.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.010
Nice.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.755
ADDY OSMANI: Something
someone could

00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:08.056
file a bug for if it
doesn't support it just yet.

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:09.500
MATT GAUNT: Fix all the bugs.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.840
ADDY OSMANI: So a shortcut that
I use quite a lot is command R,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.090
and that basically lets me
go and look up a symbol.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.920
So let's say I'm working
on a little utility library

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.844
and I want to search
through the methods.

00:01:19.844 --> 00:01:21.260
Command R would
just list them out

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.540
in a nice pretty list for me.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.169
I can easily just
jump to any method.

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:25.710
MATT GAUNT: Nice,
that's really cool.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.909
It would be really,
really good if you

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.950
could get the point where--
like for the [? S6 ?]

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.990
classes-- if it could
point to other files

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.570
that you're importing
in this one.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.278
ADDY OSMANI: Yes.

00:01:35.278 --> 00:01:37.489
MATT GAUNT: I used to
love that from all the IDs

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:38.780
from, like, native development.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.600
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah,
I think-- I want

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.440
to say that WebStorm
supports something like that,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.529
but I could be wrong.

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:46.195
I think some of their
intellisense stuff

00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:47.910
is intelligent enough
to figure that out.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.368
MATT GAUNT: That
makes sense, yeah.

00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:51.260
ADDY OSMANI: But
I could be wrong.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.230
On top of command click,
another thing you sometimes need

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.580
is the ability to smart replace.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.650
Do you do that in Atom?

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.190
MATT GAUNT: I don't
know what it is.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.481
ADDY OSMANI: OK, so smart
replace is useful for-- well,

00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:04.100
let's say you've got a variable
name or namespace where

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.262
you want to replace all of the
instances of it very quickly,

00:02:07.262 --> 00:02:09.470
and you're working with a
ton of different variables.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.105
You just select one instance
of it, use the shortcut,

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:13.480
and you can just
type in whatever

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.990
you want and it'll replace it.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.370
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.050
ADDY OSMANI: It's kind of nice.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.560
MATT GAUNT: So is that
just a bit more intelligent

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.400
than something like just
command F or whatever,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.512
just for find and replace?

00:02:22.512 --> 00:02:24.720
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah, it's in
case you need a little bit

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.540
more flexibility.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.660
MATT GAUNT: OK, cool.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.305
ADDY OSMANI: So one
thing, I love to-do apps.

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:31.680
MATT GAUNT: To-do
[? NVC, ?] just

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.740
casually drop that in there.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.490
ADDY OSMANI: Just
casually dropping it in.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.490
You know, if you create
a to-do list that's

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.530
got like-- if the first
to-do is make a to-do list,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.440
and the second is check off
the first thing on the list,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.850
you've already done two things.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.372
You can go off and have tacos.

00:02:45.372 --> 00:02:46.820
MATT GAUNT: [LAUGHING]

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.640
ADDY OSMANI: You
accomplished a lot.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.240
So I use a Sublime shortcut.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.271
I think it's shift command
L to select a line of text,

00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:55.770
and then I use
another shortcut that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.930
lets me wrap that
text inside HTML tags.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.340
And I can go and
customize what type of tag

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.370
is actually in there,
which is kind of neat.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.369
MATT GAUNT: I've played
around with this before,

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:06.710
but only through Emmet.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.490
I don't think Atom
has that command,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.580
but it's super nice,
because yeah, you just

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.177
hit that one command, add the
p tags to the [? enzo ?] size,

00:03:13.177 --> 00:03:15.260
and the next thing you
type is just-- you're going

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.915
to replace the p in that tag.

00:03:16.915 --> 00:03:18.067
It's really, really simple.

00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:19.400
ADDY OSMANI: That's pretty neat.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.530
So I've used the Emmet
plug-in for Sublime as well,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.240
and it is pretty neat.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.545
It's actually a little
bit more advanced

00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:28.575
than the wrapping stuff
I was showing before,

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:31.870
where like you've got--
I think with Emmet,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.800
you can actually supply complex
class names, and tell it,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.000
I want it to add a
variable that includes

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.390
the current index for each
item in the list, which

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.827
can be nice if you're working
on a markup list of some sort.

00:03:45.827 --> 00:03:47.410
MATT GAUNT: Emmet's
entire thing seems

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.460
to be around trying
to make you spit out

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.960
boilerplate code in the shortest
possible form that you can.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.668
The biggest problem
that I have with it--

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:56.300
and generally, with
all these keyboard

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.950
shortcuts-- is how
do you remember what

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.665
the shortcut is to then use it?

00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:02.540
Because the minute you've
got it in your head

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.520
and you understand it, it's
fine because at that point,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.960
it comes down to muscle memory.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.310
But it's getting to that point.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.865
How do you remember
the shortcuts?

00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:11.633
Do you--

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:13.530
ADDY OSMANI: I think
part of it is just

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.020
using them on a daily basis.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.440
Like with the
stuff I was showing

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.582
before, another
shortcut I commonly use

00:04:19.582 --> 00:04:21.290
is like a line bubbling
thing, that let's

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.120
me move items up and down.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.290
And it's just the
fact that I use lists

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.300
a lot in my daily
workflow that that forces

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.089
me to remember these things.

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:31.630
Something that a
lot of my friends do

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.710
is they actually-- you
are my friend, colleague.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.380
So one thing that
my friends do is

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.279
they'll print out a cheat
sheet of the shortcuts they

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.820
use pretty commonly,
and they'll just

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.710
have it sitting right
next to the keyboard.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.335
And they'll be looking
at it every day,

00:04:46.335 --> 00:04:48.180
and eventually
you'll remember it.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.600
MATT GAUNT: Thanks, colleague.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.002
So that actually
kind of a sense.

00:04:52.002 --> 00:04:54.085
It kind of sounds like one
of those old blogs that

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.300
used to be like, this
is the word of the day,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.930
and then you learn a
new word every day,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.160
except you could just have
it with keyboard shortcut,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.540
just on your desk with
a nice little bow.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.760
ADDY OSMANI: Print
it out on some paper.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.350
It's great.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.600
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, I mean,
you're kind of killing trees

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.990
and what have you,
but it's fine.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.980
We'll just pretend
that doesn't exist.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.080
ADDY OSMANI: Trees can't
give you YouTube likes, Matt.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.222
MATT GAUNT: That is true.

00:05:13.222 --> 00:05:17.846
