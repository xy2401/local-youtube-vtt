00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.790
SPEAKER 1: So, Addy, why is
there a skeleton on your desk?

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.570
ADDY: So there's a skeleton on
my desk because I ordered this

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.598
off Amazon yesterday and--

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:11.181
SPEAKER 1: Well, Matt why don't
you ask the question actually.

00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:12.660
MATT: I was just like why
are you talking to him?

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.750
Addy, he clearly teed
you up to start the show.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.490
ADDY: I know, but I was
like OK, let's reset.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.120
Start properly.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:27.630
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.530
MATT: So are you
going to explain

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.340
the skeleton in the coffin?

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.930
ADDY: Oh this?

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.230
This is a coffin I ordered
off of Amazon last night.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.510
MATT: Oh good so you needed
speedy delivery on it.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.110
ADDY: Yeah.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.610
Yeah I did.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.230
It's ruined my
recommendations now.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.300
It just keep saying
subscribe and save on coffins

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.960
for your friends and family.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.500
MATT: But why is it here Addy?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.790
ADDY: So this is here because
it's the end of an era.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.140
This is the final episode
of Totally Tooling Tips.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.228
MATT: Yeah and this is partly
my fault, mostly my fault,

00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:03.770
I don't know.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.550
It depends how you
want to spin it.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.900
ADDY: We can say it's 51%
your fault and 49% mine.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.080
MATT: So I'm actually
changing teams within Google.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.580
So I'm actually working on open
source rather than developer

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.687
relations and I can't
really do this anymore.

00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:18.250
ADDY: And I am a manager now.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.035
So I spend time-

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:20.660
MATT: Managing.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.640
ADDY: -really
managing and tweeting.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.840
MATT: So the reason we're
doing this last episode

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.180
is because it's been
a while since we've

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.110
done our last episode.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.180
ADDY: It's been like a
year since the last one.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.805
MATT: Kind of like
I don't think either

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:39.580
of us wanted to just leave it
just hanging one last episode.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.242
ADDY: Yeah.

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:41.700
MATT: We kind of
owe it to everyone

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.080
who's viewed and stuck with us.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.788
ADDY: We had people
coming up and saying,

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:46.570
will they, won't
they, do a new season.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.540
And I think a wrap up is good.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.620
MATT: Yeah, I think it's needed.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.430
So let's go back to
where we started off.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.770
ADDY: It all started
at the coffee shop.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.107
The very first episode we did
was about Sublime, I think.

00:02:00.107 --> 00:02:00.690
MATT: Oh yeah.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.110
ADDY: We did a whole ton of-

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.027
MATT: Sublime plugins.

00:02:03.027 --> 00:02:04.920
ADDY: -talking about
Sublime plugins.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.830
What's mostly changed
is a lot of people

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.520
have shifted over to VSCode.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.210
Love it.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.000
It's great.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.893
It's relatively fast.

00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:15.810
Great plugin ecosystem
and all that fun stuff.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.260
MATT: It was Atom in the middle.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.968
And that's still
actually going and being

00:02:17.968 --> 00:02:20.037
developed, which is cool.

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:22.120
Obviously you should still
be checking out plugins

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.430
because a ton of useful ones.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.730
But yeah, VSCode is the one
that I'm using now pretty

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.128
much constantly.

00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:29.670
ADDY: The coffee
shop was interesting

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.200
because we didn't
realize that it

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.840
was going to stay
running the entire time

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.890
that we were shooting.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.688
MATT: We thought we
had booked it out.

00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:38.730
ADDY: Yeah so people were
coming in to get coffee

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.050
like every five minutes.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.842
MATT: You must have
used Dreamweaver right?

00:02:41.842 --> 00:02:44.730
ADDY: Yeah I used Dreamweaver
but I used other tools

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.080
before Dreamweaver.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.433
I used Notepad.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.100
MATT: Notepad's not
really a tool is it?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.590
It's-

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.965
ADDY: What are
you talking about?

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:53.652
Notepad was the pinnacle
tool of it's time.

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:55.985
MATT: Yeah with the coffee
machine with the milk frother

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:56.210
thing.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.060
ADDY: It's fine.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.110
We totally fit in
we were like, yeah

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.920
Mocha, Chai, Jasmine,
their Starbucks order.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.780
It's great.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.030
MATT: I forgot all
of those tools.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.490
Anyway, we did those and then
we moved to the game shop

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.920
and we kind of do another
round of stuff which was good

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.280
So what do you think the
future holds for life?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.140
ADDY: The future for life?

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.120
Global warming.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.500
Skynet taking over.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.250
The human species just
being obliterated.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.395
But on the flip side, we've got
ES6 so it's all going to be OK.

00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:29.020
MATT: Everything
worked out great then.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.120
ADDY: It's going to be great.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.078
MATT: Game shop was
interesting because then we

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:34.240
had the trains running
over the top of it.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.610
But at least it was closed.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.760
So that was helpful
for the most part.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.150
Then we did the freezing
cold outside show.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.060
ADDY: Here we are back in
our natural environment,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.330
next to lifeless
barges and wildlife

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.320
that probably hates us.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.070
MATT: But it's stopped
raining so we're all right.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.278
ADDY: It has stopped raining.

00:03:52.278 --> 00:03:54.250
MATT: Look on the plus side.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.880
ADDY: The Tooling gods
are being kind today.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.770
I should also probably
say, because I

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.150
forgot to say it earlier,
I am wearing a hat right

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.390
now to distract from the
fact that if you saw,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.500
it seemed like season 1
and scenes like this season

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.960
or whatever season
this is, you may

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.610
have noticed my accent changed
a little bit in between.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.269
So the hat is to
distract from that.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.269
Because my accent is now
just one long Markov chain

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.933
generated by all
sorts of things.

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:25.350
MATT: Yeah, I'm
trying to work out

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.600
if you keep a consistent British
accent throughout the series,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.160
or whether it's
just during videos

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.535
you have a British accent,
and then outside of the videos

00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:33.540
you suddenly turn more
into a California.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.120
ADDY: I've been told that I
just have it when you're around

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.060
So I'm entirely
placing blame on you.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.310
MATT: This is why we're going
to carry on having lunch

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.410
together so at least I
have some British sounding

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.280
people around me.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.720
ADDY: I see, I see.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.500
Good.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.070
What else changed?

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.320
We went from sort of linting,
so we went from JSHint-

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.470
MATT: To ESLint.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.517
ADDY: JSCS, JSHints-

00:04:55.517 --> 00:04:56.100
MATT: Oh JSCS.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.050
ADDY: -ESLint.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.350
MATT: I forgot about JSCS.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.850
Yeah.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.960
ADDY: We should just
write a history book

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.127
about tooling at some point.

00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:04.080
MATT: And then I'm
big on TypeScript,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.680
at the moment, which means
I'm also using TSLint now.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.090
Because reasons.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.190
ADDY: TypeScript is taken off.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.360
Lots of people love it.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.750
MATT: And then there was
testing, which we told you

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.050
about Mocha and Chai.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.310
I still use Mocha and Chai
for running browser tests.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.380
ADDY: Should we do
testing framework bingo?

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.980
MATT: Yeah.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.000
Mocha, Chai, Latte, Chocolate.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.210
I mean, if you can get it
at a coffee shop it's good.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.030
ADDY: Mocha, Chai,
AVA, Jest, Cypress fits

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.050
in somewhere in there.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.960
But it is-

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.900
MATT: And then you've
obviously got Selenium.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.067
ADDY: [INAUDIBLE], Selenium.

00:05:42.067 --> 00:05:42.910
MATT: Now Puppeteer.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.885
But I've also switched
from Mocha to AVA,

00:05:44.885 --> 00:05:47.260
for the most part, unless I
need it to run in the browser

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.190
then I'm on Mocha.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.170
So a future request for
AVA, if you could run

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.188
in the browser that'd be cool.

00:05:52.188 --> 00:05:54.730
ADDY: I feel like one the things
we were talking about is how

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.000
half our time on this show was
just spent complaining about

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.440
things and hoping-

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.050
MATT: It was kind of a
therapy session for us.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.780
We'd kind of build up all
these problems during the week

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.120
and then we'd come
in to do some shows,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.437
and then it would
just be venting.

00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:11.330
ADDY: [? #BitchTheWebForward. ?]

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.360
MATT: Yeah.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.790
But thank you for anyone
who was working on a tool,

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.470
saw our video, and
actually changed something

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.450
because they thought it
would make us happier

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.185
along with all the other
developers using it.

00:06:22.185 --> 00:06:23.297
ADDY: I have to +1 that.

00:06:23.297 --> 00:06:25.630
It was really nice getting
any authors like reaching out

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.588
to us on Twitter, or
wherever else, and talking

00:06:27.588 --> 00:06:30.490
to us about our feedback or
what they're working on next.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.900
And that was kind of nice.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.340
MATT: Yeah.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.180
ADDY: Are there lessons
we want to share?

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.687
Did we learn
anything doing this?

00:06:39.687 --> 00:06:41.770
MATT: The only thing that
I feel like I've learned

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.440
is you will always end
up needing a build tool.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.840
You will need certain
tools in that build tool.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.110
ADDY: You're going to get
so much crap on Twitter

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.340
after this about, sort
of, the browser is now

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.520
able to do native
ES modules, you're

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.800
able to skip a build step during
dev time, all that fun stuff.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.920
MATT: If you're building
production web apps

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.850
you are going to
need a build tool,

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.160
unless you want to
have a horrible life.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.270
ADDY: We enjoy not
being controversial.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.640
That's great.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.260
MATT: That's my opinion.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.970
I'm going to stick with it.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.720
You can build a nice web app
without any tooling, sure.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.720
It's just going to make
your life so much easier

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.370
and your web app will be faster.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.660
Anyway.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.030
ADDY: Anyway.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.720
MATT: Yes you need to build a
build chain with minification,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.270
linting, image
optimizations, CSS

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.750
prefixing and
JavaScript prefixing,

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.910
I think, somewhere in there.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.130
And then you probably want
tooling for your GitHub pull

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.780
requests so it's actually
testing your stuff.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.210
ADDY: What tools are you
actually using at the moment?

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.400
I'm kind of curious.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.192
It's been a year since
we've shot anything.

00:07:53.192 --> 00:07:57.700
MATT: For my personal
stuff, I'm TypeScript.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.920
I'm using Gulp to
manage bill processes.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.500
I'm then using RollUp
to do minification.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.400
I'm actually using
CSS autoprefixer.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.100
I've moved away from SASS just
because with CSS variables that

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.850
was the main thing I
needed and the mixins

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.310
I've kind of shied away
from because I realized

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.200
I'd get myself in a mess.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.280
That's just me.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.740
ADDY: I feel like I've
been a little bit more

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.730
on the framework tooling side
of things for a little bit.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.300
MATT: Yeah, you were doing
a ton of stuff with PWA

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.800
supports, and
frameworks, and stuff.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.590
ADDY: Lots and lots
of Webpack and RollUp.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:38.230
Playing a lot with React, Redux,
Preacts, all those fun things.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.809
Taking a look Next
at the moment.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:43.030
MATT: You did your image
optimization book as well.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.650
ADDY: Fitted that in
somewhere in between.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.800
I feel like there's
lots of conversations

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:53.110
in the community at the moment
about sort of large scale CSS,

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.650
and whether you should use CSS
modules, styled components,

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:01.420
emotion, CSS in
JavaScript, Shadow DOM.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.410
All sorts of weird
and wonderful things.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.993
MATT: But components
are the one thing

00:09:04.993 --> 00:09:06.700
where I'm kind of-
I want to use them

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.350
but I'm not totally sure
that they're stabilized yet.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.280
ADDY: Interesting.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.620
I feel like custom elements
are at a pretty decent place.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.690
And browsers support for
Shadow DOM has been improving.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.020
But at the end of the day-

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.020
MATT: You can get pretty
far without Shadow DOM,

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.360
but it was the
polyfills and everything

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.680
to make it work always
seemed to cause me

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.930
issues to a point where it
was working in one browser,

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.000
I'd try and make it run.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.530
It didn't.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.590
And then I'd try
using the polyfills

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.007
and then it didn't
work in either,

00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:40.440
or it would work in one,
but not the- I just, yeah.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.350
ADDY: How do you stay on top
of tooling-related things

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.850
these days?

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.210
MATT: Oh, I've
willfully just pretended

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:53.800
that there are no new
tools, and as long

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.500
as I just have something
updating my packages,

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.213
and they keep on
working, I'm fine.

00:09:59.213 --> 00:10:00.130
ADDY: That seems fair.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.672
I wouldn't be surprised if a
lot of people do the same thing.

00:10:02.672 --> 00:10:04.630
MATT: Yeah, it's just as
long as they don't get

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.950
deprecated I'm fine.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.660
ADDY: I mean, the
tools are there

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.240
to help you get
productive and do stuff.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.460
And you shouldn't just
be choosing things

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.470
because they're cool, or
on the [INAUDIBLE] website,

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:16.870
or whatever.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.760
MATT: This is always
that tricky situation.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.430
You never try it, you'll
never know if it's

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.050
better for whatever reason.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.910
ADDY: This is true.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.570
MATT: And I feel like,
let's say a new minification

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.500
tool came out.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.910
Should you use it or not?

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.003
It should ultimately
kind of be determined

00:10:33.003 --> 00:10:34.420
by how long does
it take to build,

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.800
and how small is the final size?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.980
And if neither of those things
are drastically different,

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.710
it's arguable whether
you should do it or not.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.670
Again, in my opinion.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.253
Other people would argue, well
you should go for smallest size

00:10:45.253 --> 00:10:47.455
possible, and at that point
you could argue well you

00:10:47.455 --> 00:10:50.330
should just run both tools,
pick the smallest one, and run.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.970
ADDY: No, I completely agree.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.820
One thing we should say,
something that we usually

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.310
didn't have time for,
because we trying

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.650
to keep things nice
and compact, was

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.380
a huge thank you to everybody
that works on tools.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.050
Like people don't
always realize it,

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.470
but sometimes these really
super popular dependencies

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.028
are only maintained by one or
two people in their free time.

00:11:12.028 --> 00:11:13.570
And I don't think
those folks usually

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.700
get anywhere near
as much, kind of,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.680
credit for the
great work they do.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.090
MATT: Popular tools as well.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.490
You think of the issues they
probably have to deal with,

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.800
the community management,
dealing with pull requests

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.330
from random people.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.000
It's a lot to try and
then make a code base that

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.520
continues to grow
and is maintainable,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.770
and approachable, for anyone
who wants to help fix it.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.970
So, yeah, serious kudos
to anyone who does that.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.540
ADDY: Choose tools you'll use.

00:11:40.098 --> 00:11:40.640
No seriously.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.640
Choose tools you'll use.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.020
I feel like you can
watch a show like this,

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.550
and then feel like
you have to go

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:50.970
use all of the new shiny things,
and that's not always the case.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.050
It's not always going
to lead to good outcome.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.930
MATT: Choose tools you'll use.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.460
I'm just trying to unpack
that a little bit because it

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.695
makes zero sense to me.

00:11:58.695 --> 00:12:00.070
I'm like, choose
tools you'll use

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.305
is like, I don't know if
I'm going to use it until I

00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:04.430
at least pick it to try it.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.260
ADDY: Well it means
choose tools you're

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.550
going to use longer term.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.960
MATT: Tomorrow Webpack has
a new version of itself

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.600
called Ultrapack, say.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.158
Do I use it?

00:12:18.158 --> 00:12:18.700
I don't know.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.770
If I'm on Webpack it could
be better, it could not be.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:21.260
I don't-

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.302
ADDY: OK let's expand it.

00:12:22.302 --> 00:12:25.060
Choose tools you've evaluated
for a considerable period

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.710
of time, and derived value from.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.490
MATT: Oh my god.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.820
So this is why I'm leaving
Totally Tooling Tips.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.430
This is why the show's ending.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.840
No, I would just say if
a tool's working for you,

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.130
do not just change it because
you feel like the trend is

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.410
going that way.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.470
Only if you feel like the
tools that you're using

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.220
are on shaky ground,
you don't necessarily

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.010
think that they're
going to be around

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.020
in the foreseeable future,
maybe at that point

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.430
you start thinking,
well actually it's

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:55.460
not serving my purpose.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.550
Or maybe, I need to move
on to something else just

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.060
to make sure I'm not suddenly
surprised by some big issue.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.310
ADDY: So one of the great
things about this experience

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.800
has been it's kind of like
JavaScript therapy or tooling

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.450
therapy for us.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.750
MATT: Well, it's just
for us we can complain

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.580
about the current
environment that we're

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.800
in terms of workflow, tooling.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.350
Just basically going through
the churn of learning new tools,

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.410
trying new tools, keeping
on top of the tools,

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:21.680
even if we don't use them.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.260
ADDY: We know what
it's like waiting

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.320
six hours for a dependency
to properly be resolved

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.840
and a bug we figured out.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.190
So we hope that
through this show

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.320
we've conveyed some steps
that have been useful.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.780
MATT: Yeah, and we
kind of, I imagine

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.780
there's a lot of people in
the community that kind feel

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.680
like they could have
been the only ones

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.680
and everyone else is on
top of the latest tools,

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.630
and I never felt like
that, and I kind of

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.570
hope that through
Totally Tooling Tips

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.140
people felt like it was OK to
not be on top of everything.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.022
And it was also
super interesting

00:13:52.022 --> 00:13:53.980
having the community
comment on a lot of videos

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.147
kind of explaining, hey
there's a new bunch of tools

00:13:56.147 --> 00:13:57.950
that I'm using that
I'm really enjoying.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.980
And then we kind of created
this back and forth where

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.605
we're learning about
things while we're

00:14:01.605 --> 00:14:03.730
talking about new things.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.140
And, for me, it's just thank you
so much for getting involved,

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.270
and for watching, and just
taking a part in all of this.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.360
ADDY: I feel like we got
a lot out of this show.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.440
I enjoyed doing it.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.320
Got to hang out with you
a lot, we got a complain,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.490
we got to learn a
lot of new things.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.340
It's been a privilege
doing this show

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.550
and getting the opportunity
to talk to you about tools.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.520
Hopefully you got something
of value out of it.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.980
MATT: I hope the same as well.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.970
And just thank you
so much for watching.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.380
It's been awesome.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.270
It's been a fun ride.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.453
ADDY: It has been a fun ride.

00:14:36.453 --> 00:14:37.120
MATT: With that-

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.912
ADDY: So with that.

00:14:37.912 --> 00:14:40.240
MATT: One last goodbye I guess.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.040
Bye.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.190
