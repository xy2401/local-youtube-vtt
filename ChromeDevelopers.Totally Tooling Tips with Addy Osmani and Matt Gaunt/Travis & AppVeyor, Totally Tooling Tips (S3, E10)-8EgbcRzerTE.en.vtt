ADDY: So "Why Does It
Always Rain On Me?"

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.590
should probably be the
title to this episode.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.470
There is a gray cloud
coming towards us.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.290
MATT: Yeah, so for anyone
who doesn't get that,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.300
that's a nice Travis reference.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.790
Smooth.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.460
So this episode is going
to be on Travis CI, which

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.640
is a super awesome continuous
integration tool that ties in

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.860
very nicely with GitHub.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.510
So you literally,
like, enable, I

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.590
think it's like a-- you-- I
think you're adding a web hook

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.001
or something in Travis.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.250
It's a service you can--
sorry, in GitHub that you add

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.140
in to your repo and settings.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.390
And basically whenever you
do, like, a commit to a repo

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.380
or you do a pull request
or anything happens,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.654
you can set up Travis to
perform-- basically set up a VM

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:57.070
and do whatever
you tell it to do.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.800
ADDY: Yeah, all you
need to do is set up

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.346
a Travis YAML configuration file
in the root of your projects,

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:06.434
and that can be as simple or as
crazy as you want to make it.

00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:07.850
MATT: Yeah, I think
I was thinking

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.220
of the web starter
kit, Travis.YAML,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.540
and it's literally
just, like, we

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.460
need it to run in node
four, node five, and that's

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.510
all it does.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.030
And then Travis, because it's
up for an environment a node,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.488
it will go, well,
I should probably

00:01:20.488 --> 00:01:22.110
do NPM Install and
hope that works.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.400
And then it checks
for NPM run tests--

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.360
so the NPM script
just called "test"--

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.870
and it will do whatever it does,
and then given that marker,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.079
it returns an exit code
of something other than 0.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.370
And then Travis goes, well,
the build failed because it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.122
didn't do what you'd expect.

00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:38.580
And it's super handy just having
that thing just constantly

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.810
just checking what the hell
you're doing, especially

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.890
for pull requests, like
when you get someone just

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.306
give you a load
of code and you're

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:47.707
like, does this just break
everything or does it work?

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:50.040
ADDY: It's just-- it's super
useful for keeping everyone

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.890
honest about stuff that
they're trying to PR in.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.660
It's just great.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.690
I have some Travis pro-tips.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.350
MATT: Oh, are they
your own, or--

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.700
ADDY: They came to me
vividly in a dream.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.360
Or a Medium blog post.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.740
But, so one of the things we
do on a few of our projects

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.750
is we cache our package
management directory,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.820
so like our node
modules directories.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.600
Some people might cache
their [? barrel ?] components

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.462
as well.

00:02:17.462 --> 00:02:19.170
MATT: It definitely
works because you can

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.520
cache any directory, can't you?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.310
ADDY: Yeah, pretty much.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.690
MATT: If there's something
you want to generate but then

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.981
afterwards just keep it around.

00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:26.460
ADDY: Yeah, just speeds up
installation having it cached.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.293
It's kind of a nice
little thing you can do.

00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:28.940
MATT: Yeah.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.050
ADDY: Another optimization
is setting your Git checkout

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.670
depths, so that it's only
running against the latest

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.840
commits, for example.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.370
MATT: Nice.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.020
I think web fundamentals has
such a horrific history on Git

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.880
now by this point that we
should probably be using that.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.180
ADDY: I remember using
this tool to check out

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.770
the largest directories on
my system were the other day.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.520
Web fundamentals checkout
was the thickest one.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.550
MATT: Moving on.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.060
ADDY: Google engineers
know what they're doing.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.190
And my final pro-tip,
I think, was just

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.520
making sure that you know you
can whitelist or blacklist

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.750
branches, so that Travis isn't
running against everything.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.680
If you, for example, have
22 different branches

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.430
for Web Starter Kit 2, Matthew.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.820
MATT: Yeah, I should do
something about that.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.240
But the other advantage of
that that I was going to add on

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.310
was you can also--
like, Travis adds

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.002
a ton of environment variables.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.960
So if you've got shell
scripts you want to run,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.060
and maybe you want to, like,
run certain things on master,

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.851
but not when there are
pull requests or any

00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:30.735
of this other stuff,
Travis just dumps a load

00:03:30.735 --> 00:03:31.750
of environment variables.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.750
Like, one of them is just,
like, am I in Travis?

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.660
If I am, do this
rather than do it

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.450
if I ran it from a
command line or something.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.740
So that's the other thing
that's well worth checking out,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.875
because these blog posts
are just all those things.

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:44.250
ADDY: So Travis
runs really great

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.510
when you're trying to get
testing done against, like,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.730
Linux or OS X, Windows.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.490
MATT: I don't think
it supports Windows,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.990
but there is another
service called Appveyor,

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.025
and it has its own equivalent
to the Travis YAML.

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:01.710
It's slightly different,
but largely it's

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.794
very, very similar.

00:04:02.794 --> 00:04:05.210
The only gotcha with Appveyor
that I found a bit confusing

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.641
is it needs a build number
for every time it does a run.

00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:11.890
And there's a way you can
set it up to auto-increment,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.624
but it's kind of a bit weird
the first time you do it.

00:04:14.624 --> 00:04:16.540
But once you set it up,
you're all good to go,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.430
and it's super
handy because it is

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.310
pretty different from
a Linux environment.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.750
ADDY: So Appveyor, I found
it to be a little bit finicky

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.310
to get set up
pretty consistently,

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.980
but once that's done, it's
just as easy to use as Travis.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.550
MATT: Yeah, and some of those
things you only really to

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.630
have to do it at the
start of a project,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.046
and then you forget what you've
done for the next one, so,

00:04:32.046 --> 00:04:33.940
but it's all good.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.120
So then the last thing
about that is obviously

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.150
when you set these things
up is you get a lovely badge

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.430
to put on your readme.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.507
The one last thing
I'd mention, because I

00:04:43.507 --> 00:04:45.215
feel like the tour
needs a good shoutout,

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:47.310
is David, which is
this year a badge,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.280
and it just tells you whether
your dependencies on NPM

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.340
are up to date or not.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.052
That's all it does, but I
found it surprisingly helpful

00:04:55.052 --> 00:04:57.510
just for the projects I have
just sitting there just going,

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.680
well, are they up to date?

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.555
Are they out of date?

00:04:59.555 --> 00:05:01.080
What's going on?

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.010
Yeah, love it.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.940
ADDY: Yeah, so people should
check that out at david-dm.org.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.780
There's also-- so
in the same vein,

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.630
so whenever I'm working
on node modules,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.830
there's a CLI called David, very
similar thing that you can use.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.580
And what that basically
does is, again, it

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.871
will let you know your
outdated, like, dev dependencies

00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:21.730
or outdated dependencies,
list them down

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.012
in the CLI nicely colored, let
you know what your version is,

00:05:25.012 --> 00:05:26.970
the latest version is,
and it'll also give you,

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.678
like, this one-liner
you can run to just,

00:05:28.678 --> 00:05:31.772
like, instantly bump everything
up, which is kind of nice.

00:05:31.772 --> 00:05:32.272
MATT: Nice.

00:05:32.272 --> 00:05:33.280
That is very cool.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.930
ADDY: It's just pretty sweet.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.246
There's also this thing
recently called Greenkeeper.

00:05:40.246 --> 00:05:41.430
Do you remember Greenkeeper?

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.805
MATT: Yes, that's the one
where it will update everything

00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:45.580
automatically, run
your test suite,

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.190
and if it passes, it will then
ping your pull request, going,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.690
here you go.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.417
Just update them,

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:52.750
ADDY: Yeah, so people should
probably check all of those

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.610
out.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.030
MATT: If you have
good tests, yes.
