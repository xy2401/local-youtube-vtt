00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.240
ADDY OSMANI: So Matt,
I'm working on a new web

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.026
app for lonely people.

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:13.650
MATT GAUNT: OK.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.090
What does it do?

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.059
What is it called?

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.170
ADDY OSMANI: It's called
"Words With Cats."

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.920
Now-- Words With Cats.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.450
It's a brilliant name.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.760
Now, I want to show an icon
on my phone's home screen,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.260
if someone launches
this, and I also

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.680
want to be able to show
like an icon or some visual

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.500
in a splash screen.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.290
MATT GAUNT: Of a cat reading
a dictionary, or something?

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.760
ADDY OSMANI: A cat reading--
you're 're a thought leader.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.270
How can I get that done?

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.570
MATT GAUNT: So Chrome now has
the add to home screen stuff.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.780
So, basically, if you meet
a certain set of criteria

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.962
when a user is basically
engaged in your web app,

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:49.420
it will come a little banner
saying, hey, would to add this

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.310
to your home screen.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.650
So, you basically
need to be on HBS,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.960
and to have a service
worker, and you

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.440
need a web app manifest.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.904
And then after that
it's basically,

00:00:57.904 --> 00:01:00.070
depending on the user coming
back a couple of times,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.642
then it will show the banner.

00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:03.350
So the web app manifest
is the main thing

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.820
that you need, to
enable all of this,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.000
along with the other bits.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.240
But the manifest is just
a JSON file at that point.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.990
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.360
So it's just a JSON file.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.810
Is this a Chrome-only thing?

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.601
MATT GAUNT: No, no.

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:16.160
This is all the standard
space, so basically any browser

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.340
can look for this link rel tag
that links to your manifest

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.390
JSON file, at that
point they can parse it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.450
and it's just going to--
you have certain things

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.650
to find for then browsers
to take it all out.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.441
ADDY OSMANI: Right.

00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:28.960
So the manifest lets
me customize my icons.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.710
What other stuff can
I configure in there?

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.930
MATT GAUNT: So, you can
define short name, which

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.620
would be the text
underneath your icon

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.770
that you'd normally see.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.830
Theme color, which Chrome
uses, is like the URL color

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.580
along the URL bar.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.250
Background color is
for the splash screen.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.800
So, if you have that add to
home screen, then click on it,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.092
it'll launch and basically
while Chrome's loading, what

00:01:49.092 --> 00:01:50.799
you can do is show a
splash screen that's

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.050
like a solid color and then
have an icon on top of it

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.700
along with the text.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.145
So background color does that.

00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:57.770
You've got an array
of icons, so again,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.144
depending on what the browser
want's to use the icon for,

00:02:00.144 --> 00:02:02.060
it will just pick
the best size for it.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.470
Start URL is super awesome.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.590
What that is, is basically--
you remember back

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.240
in the day we used to have
add to home screen in Chrome?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.320
It was like hidden in the menu.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.889
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.597
MATT GAUNT: So, what
that would always do

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:14.970
is whatever page you're on
that is where you will get

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.490
pointed when you click on
the icon for the home screen.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.030
Start URL let's you
define where that is now.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.405
So, if someone was in the middle
of a blog article, clicked

00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:26.220
on add to home screen, now
you can say, actually, just

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.220
go to the home of the blog.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.490
Then you've got display.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.680
Display is basically rather
than launch in browser mode,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.970
you can say actually I
want it to go full screen.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:36.980
ADDY OSMANI: Oh, so
you can launch it full

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.251
screen the same way that a
native app might look like,

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:39.750
right?

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.081
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:43.080
But, alongside that there
is, also, in the spec,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.395
orientations.

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:45.940
So you could theoretically lock
it to portrait or landscape.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.020
ADDY OSMANI: Oh,
cool, so for games

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.144
that's particularly useful.

00:02:48.144 --> 00:02:52.635
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, if you want to
do like forced-- thumb sticks.

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:54.010
The nice thing,
especially, I was

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.630
going to say with the Start
URL, you can actually then add

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.550
the query parameter,
so then you can track

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.540
how many people are using it.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.740
ADDY OSMANI: Ah.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.926
MATT GAUNT: So, like
home screen equals true.

00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:03.550
And then analytics
would just show you.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.300
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.490
MATT GAUNT: So that's
pretty much the bulk of it.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.240
ADDY OSMANI: Nice.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.390
Is there-- if I wanted
to like validate

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.660
that I've got a legit manifest,
is there are tool I can use

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.160
for that?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.660
MATT GAUNT: Yes,
someone has built

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.739
a web app manifest validator.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.447
I think DevTools were
also going to do it

00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:20.625
so you can like force
a download the manifest

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:21.889
and get DevTools to parse it.

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.680
ADDY OSMANI: I believe
we mentioned as much

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.070
in Totally Tooling Tears.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.401
MATT GAUNT: But I haven't
actually used it yet, myself.

00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:31.650
And, admittedly, if you don't
use something like that,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.900
it's kind of hard to figure out
whether it's working or not.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.180
So those are well
worth checking out.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.138
ADDY OSMANI: OK, so we
talked about the web app

00:03:37.138 --> 00:03:40.130
manifest, the manifest
validator, for checking out,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.830
DevTools is looking at it.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.840
Are there docs on this
available as well?

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.381
MATT GAUNT: The best
thing to look at

00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:46.570
is [INAUDIBLE] blog post.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.320
It covers example manifests, how
do I get it to the HTML page,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.090
and then how to
debug it as well.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.449
So that's probably the best bet.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.240
ADDY OSMANI: Sweet.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.630
MATT GAUNT: And plus
it's in web starter kit,

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.900
and a whole other host of
the projects that we do.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.280
