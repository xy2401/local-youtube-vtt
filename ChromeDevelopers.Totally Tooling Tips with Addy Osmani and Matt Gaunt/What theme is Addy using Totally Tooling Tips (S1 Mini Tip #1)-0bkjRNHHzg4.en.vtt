MATT GAUNT: I remember
it was not long ago--

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.284
I think it was probably a
couple days ago-- the last time

00:00:12.284 --> 00:00:14.370
that you did a
screenshot for a tweet.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.550
And like whatever tweet the
was, people didn't care.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.580
They were just like,
what's that thing?

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.100
ADDY OSMANI: That's
my daily living,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.640
tweeting pictures of things.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.710
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, but don't
care about the content.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.120
ADDY OSMANI: They don't.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.530
MATT GAUNT: They just want to
know what theme you're using.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.210
Like what theme are
you using right now?

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.001
ADDY OSMANI: So the
theme that I love using

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.659
the most is called Seti_UI.

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:29.450
MATT GAUNT: Oh, OK.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.250
ADDY OSMANI: And
it's really nice.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.310
It's got like really
nice vibrant colors

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.570
for pretty much all
different types of syntax.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.929
And it's also got an
accompanying set of icons

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:37.970
for different file types.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.250
MATT GAUNT: Yeah,
I love the icons.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.291
I used that at one point.

00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:41.100
It's really nice.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.308
ADDY OSMANI: And one of the
nice things about Seti_UI

00:00:43.308 --> 00:00:47.320
is that it's now available
for like Atom editor, Sublime.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.900
I think Brackets
has also got it.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.980
WebStorm has got
a version of it.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.422
And you can also now get
it for your terminal,

00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:55.780
which is kind of neat, too.
