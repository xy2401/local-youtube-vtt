00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:06.670
KAYCE BASQUES: Hey there.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.750
I'm Kayce, and here's what's
new in DevTools in Chrome 59.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.440
First up is the Coverage tab.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.400
The Coverage tab shows you what
CSS and JavaScript the page

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.390
is using.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.410
Let's see how to use this
to speed up page load time.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.980
Open the Command menu with
Command Shift P on Mac

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.070
or Control Shift P
for Windows and Linux.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.380
Type coverage and
select Show Coverage.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.420
The Coverage tab opens up at the
bottom of the DevTools window.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.660
Click Reload Page, wait a
little bit for the page to load,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.210
and then click Stop Recording.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.960
You can see there's a bunch of
external files getting loaded,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.390
and most of the bytes in those
files aren't even getting used.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.230
Click on a URL to see a line by
line breakdown for that file.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.370
So to speed up page load time,
I could inline the use code

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.490
into the page's HTML
and asynchronously load

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.180
the unused code.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.710
Check out the rendering path
docs to learn more about that.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.750
Next step is full
page screenshots.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.490
For a while now you've
been able to take

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.920
a screenshot of whatever
was in the viewport,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.530
but now you can take a
screenshot of the entire page,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.530
including everything
above and below the fold.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.470
To take a screenshot,
open up the Command menu,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.610
type screenshot, and select
Capture Full Size Screenshot.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.910
Wait a little bit and DevTools
eventually downloads the image.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.330
Next up is block request URLs.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.950
This lets you see
how a page behaves

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.550
when a URL or a pattern
of URLs is blocked.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.620
This is useful for seeing
how your page behaves

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.390
when subscripts fail, or maybe
a CDN goes down, and so on.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.890
Let's see how the
DevTools home page

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.730
looks when its CSS is blocked.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.560
Go to the Network panel,
right click on a request,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.680
and select Block Request URL.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.560
You can manage your blocked
URLs in the Request Blocking

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.980
tab that pops up at the bottom
of your DevTools window.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.220
To block a pattern of
URLs, click Add and enter

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.080
a wildcard pattern.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.760
When I reload the page--

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.590
yep, looks pretty broken.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.550
It's what you would expect
if you disabled all the CSS.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.900
Also, the network panel colors
blocked requests in red.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.180
Last up is the
Unified Command menu.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.980
In the past there was
one keyboard shortcut

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.340
for opening files and another
one for jumping to a line,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.936
and so on.

00:02:21.936 --> 00:02:24.060
It was just a hassle to
remember all the shortcuts.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.842
So now you can access them
all from the Unified menu.

00:02:27.842 --> 00:02:29.300
When I open the
Command menu, there

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.350
is a greater than character
in front of my cursor now.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.540
That's the symbol
to run a command.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.640
If I replace that
with a question mark,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.900
I can see all the other
things I can do from the menu

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.940
now, like running
this handy snippet.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.400
That's what's new in
DevTools in Chrome 59.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.040
Subscribe to the Chrome
Developer's YouTube channel

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.530

and tweet us at Chrome
DevTools to discuss

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.190
any of these changes.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.800
I'll see you in six weeks
when Chrome 60 gets released.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.150
