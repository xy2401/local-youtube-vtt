00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:05.610
KAYCE BASQUES: Hello.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.982
I'm Kayce, and here's what's
new in Dev Tools in Chrome 60.

00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:11.940
If you want to improve
the quality of your site

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.700
but don't know where to
start, the new Audits Panel

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.580
is a great place to
get some inspiration.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.800
To run an audit,
click the Audits tab,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.530
click Perform an Audit,
then click Run Audit.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.510
After 15 seconds
or so, Dev Tools

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.530
gives you a report on the page.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.230
These top level
scores are a summary

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.030
of how you did in that category.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.040
Below that are the
individual tests that

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.080
make up each category's score.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.860
Fix the failing tests to improve
the quality of your page.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.170
This new Audits Panel is
powered by an Open Source

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.610
project called Lighthouse.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.320
Check out the
Lighthouse GitHub repo

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.990
if you've got some ideas
for audits we should build,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.260
or if you want to
contribute them yourself.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.940
If you're working on
a big site, chances

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.310
are that your pages
interact with components

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.520
from other teams in your
company, or ad networks,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.770
or libraries, and so on.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.800
Third party badges help you see
which third parties might not

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.980
be playing too nicely
with your pages.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.740
Enable badges by opening
the Command menu, which

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.460
is Command-Shift-P on
Mac, or Control-Shift-P

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.780
on Windows and Linux.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.296
Start typing badges, then
select Show Third Party Badges.

00:01:18.296 --> 00:01:19.670
In the Network
Panel, you can now

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.400
see a little badge next
to each request indicating

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.922
who caused it.

00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:25.380
And in the console,
you can see who

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.420
caused a message or a
violation to be logged.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.150
You can also sort
performance recordings

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.560
by selecting the Group
Bi-Product option.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:36.890
When you're paused
on a line of code,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.840
you often want to
continue execution up

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.250
to some later point.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.270
The new Continue to Here gesture
can speed up this workflow.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.400
Right now, I'm
paused on line nine.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.150
I want to execute up to line
20 then pause on that line.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.490
To do this, I hold
Command on Mac,

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.550
or Control on Windows
and Linux, and Dev Tools

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.040
highlights Destinations in blue.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.630
From here, I click
on the destination

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.080
to execute the script
up to that point.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.960
The Context Selection menu
now provides more information

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.370
about the frames on a page.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.860
Before, you would just get
a default dropdown menu.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.010
Now Dev Tools gives frames
more descriptive names.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.600
Also, when you
hover over a frame,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.640
Dev Tools highlights
it in the viewport.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.780
The console now provides
more helpful object previews.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.840
Before, Dev Tools would just
display the string object

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.610
when logging out an object.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.350
Not that useful.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.130
Now it shows you more of
the object's contents.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.620
The Coverage tab now
provides real time updates

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.810
while recording.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.100
Before, it would
just say recording,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.440
which would force you to
stop your recording in order

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.330
to analyze the results.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.040
But now you can
analyze the results

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.930
while the recording
is still happening.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.430
The Network Throttling
menu has been

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.870
simplified to the most popular
options, Slow 3G, Fast 3G,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.550
and Offline.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.020
Also, the team
tweaked the settings

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.690
to better match real
world 3G connections.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.570
So you might notice that
pages load slower now

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.290
when throttling is enabled.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.450
Last, the Async checkbox in the
Sources panel has been removed.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.620
And its functionality
is now on by default,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.940
because there's no longer
a performance overhead.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.530
You can still disable
it from Settings

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.430
if you need it off
for some reason.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.690
That's all for Chrome 60.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.400
If you want to
discuss these changes,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.830
start a thread in the
mailing list, or tweet

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.600
us @ChromeDevTools.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.330
And if you want the latest news
and ideas in web development,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.840
subscribe to the Google Chrome
Developer's YouTube channel.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.030
I'll see you in six
weeks for Chrome 61.
