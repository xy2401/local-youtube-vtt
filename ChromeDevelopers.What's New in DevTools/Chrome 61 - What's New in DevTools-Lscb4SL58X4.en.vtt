KAYCE BASQUES: Hi there.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.680
I'm Kayce, and here's what's
new in DevTools in Chrome 61.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.420
The new Mobile Device
Throttling menu

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.420
lets you simulate a low-end
or mid-tier mobile device

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.850
with a couple of clicks.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.000
Press Toggle Device Toolbar
to enter device mode.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.620
The Mobile Device
Throttling menu

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.080
is set to Online
by default. Click

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.600
it to see the mobile
device options.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.340
Select low-end
mobile, and you see

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.610
warning icons pop up next to the
Network and Performance tabs.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.240
These are here to remind you
that you've got network and CPU

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.040
throttling enabled.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.780
Now when you interact
with your pages,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.540
you can get a better idea
of how they load and respond

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.550
on a low-end device.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.700
To see exactly how DevTools
defines a low-end device,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.910
hover over the menu or go
to the Performance panel

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.460
and open the Capture
Settings menu.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.260
The Throttling menu
is just a shortcut

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.620
for setting the network
and CPU options here.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.150
You can see that
they automatically

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.960
update when I set the
Throttling menu back to Online.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.420
The new usage chart on
the Clear Storage pane

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.150
breaks down how much
storage your page

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.400
is using, organized
by technology.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.260
Another new feature in
the application panel

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.480
is the Time Cached
column, which tells you

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.910
when a response was cached.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.490
Also new, you can now
enable the FPS meter

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.720
from the Command menu.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.540
Press Command-Shift-P on
Mac, or Control-Shift-P

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.540
on Windows and Linux to
open the Command menu.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.834
Type FPS, then select Show
Frames Per Second Meter.

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.250
In the top right
of your viewport,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.010
there's now an overlay
that shows your page's FPS

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.680
performance in real time.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.730
If you work with a lot of
performance recordings,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.210
there's now a setting to
change how your mouse wheel

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.700
or trackpad behaves while
you're analyzing a recording.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.270
Here I've got a
recording of a page load.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.280
By default, when I
swipe up and down

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.390
with two fingers
on this section,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.360
DevTools zooms in and out.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.810
But if I open up Settings and
set Flame Chart Mouse Wheel

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.330
Action to Scroll,
now that action

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.560
scrolls the section instead.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.620
ES6 modules are shipping
natively in Chrome 61,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.940
and debugging in DevTools
works as you'd expect it to.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.564
Right now we're paused on this
On function in bootstrap.js.

00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:20.480
It says here that we're
importing the function

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.030
from helpers.js.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.530
When I step into
this function, it

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.071
should jump us to its
definition in helpers.js.

00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:28.570
Neat.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.490
That's all for Chrome 61.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.480
Thanks for watching.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.090

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.330

Developers YouTube channel to
keep up on the latest ideas.

weeks for Chrome 62.
