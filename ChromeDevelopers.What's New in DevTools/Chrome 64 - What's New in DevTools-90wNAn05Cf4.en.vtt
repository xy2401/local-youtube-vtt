00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.010
Welcome back.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.120
In Chrome 64 we've got a
new Performance Monitor,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.510
a new UI for filtering the
console, and automatic message

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.646
groupings in the console.

00:00:15.646 --> 00:00:17.020
The Performance
Monitor gives you

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.470
a real time view of a whole
bunch of performance metrics.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.260
To open the monitor,
press Shift-P on Mac,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.810
or Control-Shift-P
on Windows and Linux,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.600
start typing performance,
then select Show Performance

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.010
Monitor.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.659
The monitor opens up in
what we call the drawer.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.040
Press Escape to hide
or short the door.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280
You can also explore
all of the tabs

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.810
in the drawer via
this menu over here.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.450
Here on the left
side of the monitor,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.600
we have the different metrics
you can monitor in real time.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.210
The gray ones are hidden.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.780
Click a metric to
hide or show it.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.600
Note that the color coding
on the CPU usage chart

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.150
is the same as the color
coding in performance panel

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.780
recordings.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.320
Note also that the frames metric
refers to document frames, not

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.180
frames per second.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.220
If you want frames per second,
use the FPS meter, which you

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.470
can open via the Command Menu.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.850
If your pages are logging
a lot of messages,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.760
the new Console Sidebar can
help you filter out the noise

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.640
and focus on the messages
that you care about.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.620
Over in the console,
the sidebar is

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.090
hidden by default. Click Show
Console Sidebar to open it.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.650
This top item is equivalent
to showing all messages.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.890
Expand it, then select
one of the scripts

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.744
below to only show messages
coming from that script.

00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:34.160
When you want to
focus on messages

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.910
with this certain
severity level,

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.660
such as errors or
warnings, click that item

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.100
to show all messages with that
level, or expand the level

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.960
and select one of
the scripts below it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.200
to only show messages from that
script that match that severity

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.850
level.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.860
Note that the info
level includes

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.820
console.log and
console.infomessages.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.070
You can combine the sidebar
with the filter text

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.410
box for some pretty
specific filtering.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.010
For example, you can
enter a regular expression

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.100
in the filter box, or you can
type a minus sign followed

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.949
by some text, and the
console hides any message

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.220
that includes that text.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.500
The last feature we've
got coming in Chrome 64

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.980
is automatic message
groupings in the console.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.050
Over here you can see that
the console now groups

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.350
similar messages together.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.540
This badge over here
tells you how many times

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.430
that message was logged.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.100
Click to expand the grouping
and see each individual message.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.167
You can uncheck the
group similar checkbox

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:35.500
if you don't want this behavior.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.290
That's all for Chrome 64.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.120
Here's a bonus tip
that makes it easier

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.510
to work with elements
that have hover effects.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.890
Here I'm looking
at a little demo

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.190
of that showcases a bunch
of different hover effects.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.810
Suppose I want to
inspect or tweak

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.240
what CSS gets applied to this
element when I hover over it.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.450
I could go back and forth
between making my changes

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.990
in DevTools, then manually
hovering over the element,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.700
but there's an easier way.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.730
Inspect the element, then open
the Toggle Element State Menu,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.150
then check hover, and
I forced the element

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.640
into the hover state even
though I'm not actually

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.206
hovering over it.

00:03:15.206 --> 00:03:16.580
DevTools puts a
little orange dot

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.950
next to the element and
the Dom tree to remind you

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.191
that you're messing
with its state.

00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:22.690
That's it.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.750
Thanks for watching.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.810
See you in six
weeks for Chrome 65.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.960
