[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:06.850
KAYCE BASQUES: Welcome back.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.060
Here's what's new in
DevTools and Chrome 67.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.680
First up, in the
Network panel, you

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.766
can now search across
network headers.

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.390
When you've got the
Network panel open,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.320
press Command-F or Control-F
to open the new search UI.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.170
Enter some text, press
Enter, and DevTools searchers

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.770
across all network headers
and responses for that text.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.000
Click Use Regular Expressions
to provide a pattern instead.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.420
Note that you omit the forward
slashes when using regex.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.220
Also new to the
Network panel, you

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.550
can now copy network requests
as fetch expressions.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.200
The Sources panel now
supports a workflow

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.660
for breaking out
of infinite loops.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.120
Here on this page, I've
got an interval logging

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.440
the current time.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.970
When I click this
button, you can

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.940
see that it causes an infinite
loop because the time is

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.650
no longer updating.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.180
To break out of
the infinite loop,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.410
I pause the page, then hold
Resume, then select Stop.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.040
The Styles pane is
getting a couple updates

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.430
that make it easier to
work with CSS variables.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.610
When you've got a color property
that's set to a CSS variable,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.830
the Styles pane now shows
you a preview of that color.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.680
You can also hover
over any variable,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.680
whether it resolves to a
color or something else,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.740
and DevTools shows you
its computed value.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.830
The color picker also has
a new CSS variables palette

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.854
which shows you the
CSS variables that

00:01:30.854 --> 00:01:31.770
apply to that element.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.190
The Audits panel has
some new workflows

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.140
for configuring and
viewing the ports,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.750
as well as two new audits.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.690
Before you run an audit, you
can use these new config options

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.170
to preserve desktop settings,
disable throttling, or preserve

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.580
storage.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.460
After you run an audit,
you'll notice two new audits--

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.490
preloading key requests
and avoiding invisible text

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.470
while loading web fonts.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.440
Last, if you want to analyze
your report in the Performance

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.600
panel, click the new
View Trace button.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.130
Also new in the
Performance panel,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.020
you can now click
the user timing track

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.070
to view your measurements
in the Summary, Call

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.382
Tree, and Bottom-Up tabs.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:13.840
This is related to
work we're doing

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.600
around site isolation,
which improves security

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.880
by separating frames
into different processes.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.810
So if you see a lot of frames
on your main thread flame chart,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.900
it means you've got
site isolation enabled.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.120
Likewise, you can click
any of these tracks

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.370
in order to isolate
that information, just

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.320
like the user timing track.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.410
The Security panel now shows
you certificate transparency

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.990
information for each origin.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.460
That's all for new features.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.040
Here are some UI changes.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.940
The Memory panel now lists
out all available VM instances

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.720
in a table rather than hiding
them behind a dropdown menu.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.970
On the Sources panel,
what used to be called

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.090
the Network tab is now
called the Page tab.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.640
And last, we've been
making various small tweaks

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.660
to the dark theme, so it should
feel a little less Halloweeny

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.120
now.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.610
That's all for Chrome 67.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.020
Here's a bonus tip.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.190
Surma actually made a Micro
Tip video on this already,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.080
but I think it's so cool that
it deserves another mention.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.960
When you want to figure out
how an animation's layers work,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.630
press Command-Shift-P
or Control-Shift-P

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.370
to open the command menu.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.230
Open the Animations tab.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.900
Click Set Speed to 10%.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.850
Open the Command menu again.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.080
Open the Layers panel.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.970
And then rotate the
perspective a bit

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.190
so that it's easier
to see the layers.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.800
Now when you interact
with the page,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.620
you can see how the
layers animate in slow-mo.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.066
Thanks for watching.

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:45.690
As always, leave me
a comment if you've

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.320
got questions or feedback.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.350
Otherwise, I'll see you in
six weeks for Chrome 68.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.100
