00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.020
KAYCE BASQUES: Salutations.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.990
We've got seven new features
and one minor change

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.930
coming to DevTools in Chrome 73.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.420
Logpoints let you log
messages to the console

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.650
without cluttering up your code
with console.log statements.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.520
First, you need to open a
file in the Sources panel.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.420
A fast way to do
that when you know

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.740
the file name is to press
Control-O, or Command-O on Mac,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.800
type the file name,
then press Enter.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.740
To add a logpoint,
right-click a line number

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.200
and select Add Logpoint.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.390
In the Breakpoint Editor,
type the expression

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.030
that you want to
log to the console.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.790
Side note, check out the
Art of Debugging article

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.680
that we've linked to
in the description

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.430
to learn more about this
handy shorthand syntax.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.890
When your expression is
ready, press Enter to save it.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.710
The next time that
the code runs,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.040
the result of the logpoint
is logged to the console.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.110
First I'll press
Escape so that we

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.760
can see the console directly.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.180
In this case, I need to
reload the page in order

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.430
for this code to run.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
As expected, the expression
has been logged to the console.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.775
To temporarily
deactivate the logpoint,

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:17.160
hold Shift and then click it.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.040
To delete a logpoint, just
give it a regular click.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.190
When inspecting a
node, DevTools now

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.280
shows an expanded tool tip
containing commonly needed

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.800
information about the node.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.710
To enter Inspect mode,
press Control-Shift-C,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.150
or Command-Shift-C on Mac, or
click the Inspect Mode icon.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.160
Back in an earlier
version of Chrome,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.360
when I hover over a node, I just
see the node type and its size.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.700
When I do the same
in Chrome 73, I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.060
see the node's color,
font, margin, and contrast.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.340
Code coverage data can now
be exported as a JSON file.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.670
To open the Coverage tab,
press Control-Shift-P,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.090
or Command-Shift-P on Mac,
to open the Command menu.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.900
Start typing Coverage
then select Show Coverage.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.970
To review, when I
reload the page,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.790
DevTools tells me how
much code from each file

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.860
is actually being used.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.670
When I click a file, I see
a line-by-line breakdown.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.160
To export the
code, click Export,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.210
which downloads the
data as a JSON file.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.730
The URL property describes
what file is analyzed,

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.610
the Arranges property
describes the portions of code

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.130
that were used, and
the Text property

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.220
contains the full
text of the file.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.040
In this example,
the JSON is telling

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.710
me that the substring
between index 0

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.580
and index 21 of the
text string was used

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.260
as well as the substring
between index 49 and index 71.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.300
To extract the used
code, I would just

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.230
concatenate these substrings.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.380
The console can now be
navigated with a keyboard.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.750
To start navigating the
console with a keyboard,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.400
press Shift-Tab.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.740
Use the Up and Down
arrow keys to select

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.380
messages or parts of a message.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.050
When a URL is selected,
pressing Enter

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.860
opens that file in a new tab
if it's an external file.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.500
To expand a message,
you need to first select

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.860
the whole message, which is
indicated by a blue background,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.170
and then press the
Right arrow key.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.020
Pressing Enter on a
link to a page resource

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.150
opens up the Sources
panel for scripts

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.150
or the Network panel
for network requests.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.270
To collapse, press Left to
reflect the message then

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.370
press Left again.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.140
The Color Picker now shows a AAA
contrast ratio line in addition

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.180
to the AA line.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.850
To see contrast ratio
information in the Color

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.170
Picker, enter Inspect Mode,
select a node containing text,

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.770
go to the Styles pane, click
the box next to the node's color

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.830
property, then click Show More.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.650
Since this node meets
the AAA recommendation,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.140
anything below this line also
meets the AAA recommendation,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.380
which is considered
very readable.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.950
Anything between the two lines
meets the AA recommendation

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.560
but does not meet the AAA one.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.340
In other words, this is the
bare minimum for readability.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.160
And anything above the
top line doesn't even

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.310
satisfy the AA recommendation,
which is considered unreadable.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.080
Custom geolocation overrides can
now be saved across sessions.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.500
Press Control-Shift-P, or
Command-Shift-P on Mac,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.330
to open the Command menu.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.810
Start typing Sensors
then select Show Sensors.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.970
The Sensors tab is
where you can manually

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.600
override your geolocation
while DevTools is open.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.570
Click Manage, then
click Add Location.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.990
Enter the name, latitude,
and longitude of your custom

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.550
location, then click Add.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.740
The Sources and Network panels
now support code folding.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.540
To enable code folding, press
F1 to open Settings, scroll

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.750
to the Sources section,
then check the Code Folding

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.890
checkbox.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.220
To fold a section of code,
hover near the line number

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.540
and press the Fold icon.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.270
The name of the tab for
inspecting WebSocket messages

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.040
has changed.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.830
When you wanted to inspect
WebSocket connections

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.560
in earlier versions of
Chrome, the Frames tab

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.960
was where you inspected
the upstream and downstream

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.250
messages.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.410
As of Chrome 73, this tab is
now called the Messages tab.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.970
Its behavior is
the same as before.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.390
Here's a bonus tip about
a lesser-known DevTools

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.070
feature that has been
around for a long time.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.400
The Network panel
supports special keywords

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.890
that let you filter
network resources based

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.760
on certain properties
of each resource.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.980
To log network activity,
I'll go to the Network

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.930
panel then reload the page.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.200
To filter by domain,
I type Domain:

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.710
and I see a list of
domains of page resources.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.770
To only share resources
larger than 10 kilobytes,

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.050
I type larger-than:
and then select 10k.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.470
Check out the Filter Requests by
Property section in our Network

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.800
Reference to see the
full list of keywords.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.880
That's all, folks.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.790
Send me questions and
feedback in the comments

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.120
and see you in six
weeks for Chrome 74.
