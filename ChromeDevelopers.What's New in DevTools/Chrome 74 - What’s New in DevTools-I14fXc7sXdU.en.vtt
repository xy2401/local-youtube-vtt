[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.275 --> 00:00:06.150
KAYCE BASQUES: Howdy.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.970
Here's what's new in
Dev Tools in Chrome 74.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.850
First up, DevTools now
highlights all nodes

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.020
affected by a CSS property.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.230
Here, I've got DevTools
open alongside the DevTools

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.280
homepage.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.500
I want to view the styles
for this paragraph,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.890
so I click Inspect, and
then I click the paragraph.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.620
When I hover over margin,
I see orange boxes

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.890
before and after
each paragraph node.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.800
This means that the margin
property I'm hovering over

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.690
applies to all these nodes.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.940
When I change
padding to 10 pixels

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.380
and then hover over that, I see
green boxes around the node.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.530
The Audits panel has a new
tap targets audit, as well as

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.310
a new badging system
for the PWA audit.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.670
The new tap targets audit
checks that interactive nodes

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.250
like buttons and links are
usable for mobile users.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.460
For example, if a
button and a link

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.980
are too small and
too close together,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.190
a mobile user may tap the link
by mistake when they actually

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.140
meant to tap the button.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.120
In this report,
the Audits panel is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.750
saying that the File a Bug link
is overlapping the View Source

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.590
link.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.630
To simulate mobile
and see this problem

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.450
myself, I'll click
Toggle Device Toolbar

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.740
and pick an arbitrary
mobile device, say Pixels 2.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.540
When I scroll to
the bottom, I see

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.300
the File a Bug link with
the View Source link right

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.600
below it.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690
So it makes sense
that these tap targets

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.030
might be too close on mobile.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.310
In general, to pass
the audit, I need

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.790
to make sure that the targets
are at least 48 pixels tall

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.000
and 48 pixels wide,
with 8 pixels of space

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.650
between targets.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.620
Moving on to the PWA category,
when you pass a section,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.540
such as Fast and
Reliable, you get a badge.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.650
And if you pass
all three sections,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.550
you get a checkmark for the
PWA category [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.980
You can now view binary
WebSocket messages

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.650
from the Network panel.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.800
To view WebSocket messages,
go to the Network panel,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.070
click the row that represents
a WebSocket connection,

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.440
then open the Messages tab.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.080
A binary message from
the browser to the server

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.860
has a green up arrow next
to it, and a binary message

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.990
from the server
to the browser has

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.350
a red down arrow next to it.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.520
Click a binary message
to view its content

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.000
in the section below the table.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.295
Click the Format list to
convert from the default hex

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:33.530
to base 64 or UTF-8, and
click Copy to copy the message

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.000
content to your clipboard.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.850
The Command menu
now has a command

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.820
for capturing area screenshots.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.360
Press Control-Shift-P or
Command-Shift-P on Mac

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.860
to open the Command menu.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.120
Start typing "area," then
press Enter to run the command.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.370
Drag your mouse over the
section of the viewport

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.170
that you want to
screenshot, then

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.640
release your mouse to
capture the screenshot.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.420
You can now filter the network
log to only show requests

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.680
that a service worker
caused or intercepted.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.370
Type is:service-worker-initiated
to view requests that were

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.130
caused by a service
worker, or type

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.730
is:service-worker-intercepted
to view requests that matched

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.070
a service worker route.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.140
The Performance panel now marks
up long tasks and First Paint.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.180
Here, I've got a
recording of the page load

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.310
performance of Google Maps.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.300
Tasks are now shown at the top
of the main thread flame chart.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.530
Long tasks have a red triangle
in their top-right corner.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.840
In the Timing section, the new
First Paint marker is shown.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.390
Here's a bonus tip on a
lesser-known feature that's

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.540
been in DevTools
for a long time.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.930
By default, the Styles
pane shows hex color codes.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.760
To view RGB or HSL, hold Shift
then click the color box.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.220
That's all for Chrome 74.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.810
Leave me questions and
feedback in the comments.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.720
Otherwise, I'll see you in
six weeks for Chrome 75.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.470
