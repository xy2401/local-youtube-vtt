00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.930
KAYCE BASQUES:
Chrome 77 approaches.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.610
Here's what's new in DevTools.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.670
First up, you can now copy
an element's CSS styles.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.960
I like the styles on this link
element and want to copy them.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.150
First, I right click
and select Inspect

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.370
to highlight the
link in the DOM tree.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.420
Actually, I want to make
the font italic first.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.820
Now I'll right click the element
and select Copy, Copy Styles.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.570
And when I paste
to the Clipboard,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.409
I can see the element styles,
including my font style,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.390
italic declaration.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.420
When you're reading an article
and the content jumps around,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.010
that's called layout shifting.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.110
It usually happens
because ads and images

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.700
have finished
loading, and the page

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.740
didn't reserve space for them.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.740
You can now visualize layout
shifts from the rendering tab.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.570
However, a word of
warning, this feature

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.430
can cause your screen
to flash a lot.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.190
So if you're prone to
photosensitive epilepsy,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.200
you might want to look away.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.650
To visualize layout shifts,
first press Control-Shift-P

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.290
or Command-Shift-P to
open the Command menu.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.520
Type Rendering.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.560
Run the Show Rendering command.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.130
And then enable the Layout
Shift Regions checkbox.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.500
Now, as you load or
interact with pages,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.740
layout shifts are
highlighted blue.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.180
The Audits panel has a couple
new audits and a new metric.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.870
As always, if you want to find
ways to improve page quality,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.750
go to the Audits Panel,
then click Run Audits.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.360
And after 10 seconds
or so, the Audits Panel

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.760
gives you a report
on how to improve.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.270
The estimated input latency
metric in the Performance

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.570
section has been replaced with
a new metric called Maximum

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.820
Potential First Input Delay.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.700
The old metric did not factor
into your performance score.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.670
And the new one doesn't either.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.990
The new keep request
counts and file

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.930
sizes low audit reports
the total number of network

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.900
requests and the
size of each request.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.800
And down in the PWA section,
the new Apple Touch icon audit

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.970
checks that your PWA can be
added to an iOS home screen.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.530
DevTools now automatically syncs
its theme with your OS theme.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.199
Right now, my OS is
in its dark theme.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.290
When I open DevTools,
it's also in dark theme.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.750
When I set my OS
to its light theme

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.450
and then close and
reopen DevTools,

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.760
DevTools is also
in its light theme.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.450
By the way, dark
theme isn't new.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.820
We've had it for a long time.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.650
To manually enable it,
press Control-Shift-P

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.310
or Command-Shift-P to
open the Command menu.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.090
Type dark.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.820
Then run the Enable
Dark Theme command.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.520
For light theme, run the
Enable Light Theme command.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.920
If you create conditional
breakpoints or log points

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.810
a lot, there's a new
keyboard shortcut

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.210
for opening the
breakpoint editor.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.920
While my cursor
is in the editor,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.950
I can press Control-Alt-B
or Command-Option-B

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.620
on Mac to open the
breakpoint editor.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.300
To choose my
breakpoint type, I can

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.210
press Shift-Tab to
select the menu, then

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.860
Space to open the menu.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.380
Then I can select either
Breakpoint or Conditional

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.520
breakpoint or Logpoint.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.030
If you're not sure how to
use Conditional breakpoints

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.530
or Logpoints,
check out the links

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.430
in the description
for more information.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.640
Prefetch links
give you the chance

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.350
to download resources
before they're

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.440
needed in order to speed
up subsequent page loads.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.960
The network panel now
indicates whether a resource

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.160
came from the prefetch cache.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.690
On this page, I'm prefetching
an HTML file and a CSS file.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.370
In the network
panel, you can see

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.620
that the resources were
downloaded even though they're

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.650
not actually needed for
the page I'm currently on.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.200
When I navigate to
page 2, the size column

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.900
tells me that the resources
came from the prefetch cache.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.110
Check out our Resource
Prioritization guide

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.400
to learn more about prefetch.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.510
The console now shows
private class fields.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.280
In this older version
of Chrome, I'm

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.010
defining a class called
Cat with a public field

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.310
called name and a private
field called color.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.460
When I inspect the object, I
can't see the private field.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.490
In Chrome 77, after I
define the same class

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.230
and inspect the
object, I can see

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.290
the private field as expected.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.300
The background
services section now

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.330
supports push messages
and notifications.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.030
A push message is when a
server sends information

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.200
to a service worker.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.570
And a notification is
when a service worker

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.000
shows information to a user.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.270
To record notifications, go
to the Application panel,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.700
then go to the
Notifications pane.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.470
Then click Record.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.410
Now, when I send a notification,
I see it logged to the table.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.130
I can click the notification to
view more information about it.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.647
However, considering that
this is a background service,

00:04:37.647 --> 00:04:39.230
it wouldn't be that
helpful if it only

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.360
worked when DevTools was open.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.240
So DevTools logs notifications
and push messages

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.300
for three days, even
when DevTools is closed.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.340
For example, first,
I'll close DevTools,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.580
then change the title
and message to closed,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.290
then send the message.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.660
To reopen DevTools, I'll
press Control-Shift-I

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.800
or Command-Option-I, which
is the shortcut for reopening

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.540
the last panel I was using--

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.580
in this case, the
Application panel.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.470
And here, you can see that
the second message was logged.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.130
Here's a bonus tip about a
lesser-known DevTools feature--

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.380
the DOM tree's search UI.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.040
To open the DOM tree's search
UI, focus the DOM tree,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.460
then press Control-F
or Command-F on Mac.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.150
You can search by strings
like DevTools or CSS selectors

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.000
like input type equals
hidden or even XPath queries.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.120
Thanks for watching.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.510
We'll be back in six
weeks for Chrome 78.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.860
