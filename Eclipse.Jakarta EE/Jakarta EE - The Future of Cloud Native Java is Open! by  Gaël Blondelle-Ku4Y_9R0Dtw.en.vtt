00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:42.870
 you can get the implementation 

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.000
 of resources 

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:47.279
 this verse our specifications c and 

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.749

 red mike profile 

00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:16.459
 specifications so what is eclipse 

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:22.279
 macrophages basic liszt started with 

00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:25.470
 10 this offer to specifications 

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:28.230
 sidiailles jason pidgeon says jack is 

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:33.029
 right now on google you you see that 

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:37.639
 it's what you need to create jobs macro 

00:14:33.029 --> 00:14:44.069
 micro services engine scene after that 

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:49.240
 was a with the release of a 

00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:51.399
 approach the holden ead works 

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:55.690
 specific non-functional property and 

00:14:51.399 --> 00:15:00.339
 especially need to my nature you macro 

00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:03.640
 services soa difficult escape to get the 

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:06.940
 result is my cros service still 

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:09.420
 walking metrics with default metrics 

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:14.020
 beatles at applications level metrics 

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:17.830
 fault tolerant this type i call if you if 

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:21.430
 you have chain of my service cros sanyo 

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:23.910
 canada nothing to fear example that the 

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:30.580
 breaker circuit on stuff like that 

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:34.330
 open racing for service strong racing 

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:37.570
 between between long service this 

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:43.420
 shane open service and worst terrorists 

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:45.420
 clients' so you see that is mostly 7 

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:48.750
 except to note changes a man 

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:51.640
 windows 7 sofa notation need 

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:58.570
 everything you need at any price there is 

00:15:51.640 --> 00:16:01.480
 create wan macros services 

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:04.240
 interesting stuff with micro eclipse 

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:09.550
 profile that it's really lightweight 

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:15.790
 process to define you specifications a 

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:16.329
 tipi hill nowadays vertex team will do 

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:20.579
 dated 

00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:23.890
 the ipad collaborated thing you speak for 

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:27.190
 reactive streaming programming in my mind 

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:30.010
 about find and so that is that when i 

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:33.010
 wanted to mansion vertex watches which 

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:37.149
 will be the art of french implementation 

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:38.819
 provide everything 

00:16:37.149 --> 00:16:41.189
 you need to 

00:16:38.819 --> 00:16:42.299
 everything is really responsive programming 

00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:46.289
 reactive stream 

00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:52.439
 so that very light weight polyglot 

00:16:46.289 --> 00:16:59.309
 framework this event missed one of our 

00:16:52.439 --> 00:17:04.230
 complicated blocking at micro synchronoss 

00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:06.600
 service so you can not go to michael 

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.439

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.770
 e mailing list 

00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:14.310
 then you will see signs or 

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:20.670
 responsive streaming mode specifications 

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:26.610

 the project of the project 

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:07.870
 will with all the resources unites all 

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:10.970
 collaborated on github you get up project 

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:15.530
 e mailing list this bug tracker and 

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:17.480
 everything and there is the initial 

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.850
 contribution nichol contribution mind 

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:22.580
 that the owner of the project 

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:25.700
 intellectual property t have to put 

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:28.820
 together instead on 611 sausages 

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:31.180
 all his clips foundation and then the 

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:34.910
 cloud foundations will review the 

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:38.090
 intellectual property and when it's ok 

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:40.460
 we know where it comes from we know that 

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:42.520
 the people who could have 

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:46.040
 right to publish it in open source 

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:49.070
 10:10 conditions so you can not touch 

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.890
 local all positive guitry 

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:54.290
 and then you are in the working in 

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:59.920
 eclipse foundation repositories status 

00:20:54.290 --> 00:21:06.250
 and if you look at 10 status satis the 

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:09.050
 current status everything now is it is 

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:12.680
 working in eclipse chains 

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:15.710
 repositories this it means that all 

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:18.410
 project i'll have been migrating ty all 

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:21.920
 its clips servers and the community and 

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:24.650
 start collaborating in 2nd project and 

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:27.140
 now the next up is here 

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:29.600
 you to create the first official review 

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:32.380
 official willy cording touzit eclipse 

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.380
 process development 

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:38.700
 so that for the technical door is said 

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:41.210
 organizational door 

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:45.019
 we have the jakarta globe king group 

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:48.840
 what is the jakarta ring globe done 

00:21:45.019 --> 00:21:55.019
 approve specifications and 15 still in 

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:57.870
 oz is a pretty raid specs

 glassfish and supplementation 

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:07.080
 technology compatibility kit what's 

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:11.549
 really interesting and moving java 

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.210
 jakarta is not only glassfish is 

00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:14.460
 open source 

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:17.460
 she foams the whole team are some 

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:20.460
 stars is open source you are note 

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:22.740
 big big difference of technology 

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:28.470
 compatibility leaves to open source 

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:30.299
 engine for all the specifications will 

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:36.869
 be made in open source 

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:40.679
 wade co yezh jakarta 

00:22:36.869 --> 00:22:43.220
 to the specifications manager this jakarta 

00:22:40.679 --> 00:22:48.090
 ibres and goes wild new brain 

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:54.690
 so it means that he will we protect 

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:56.999
 the wind that has value to be not every 

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:59.610
 body will be able to it's ok ayem 

00:22:56.999 --> 00:23:02.519
 jakarta complained go as back to 

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:05.669
 that let her and also established 

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:07.889
 technical roadmap causes yes they 

00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:10.649
 want even if it be com / open and 

00:23:07.889 --> 00:23:13.520
 more at giles we still need to have some 

00:23:10.649 --> 00:23:20.360
 ntsama coordination 

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:23.510
 bitter virgin to where it is going 

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:26.000
 front of our sun shines body channel 

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:29.600
 audited sites good thing at road inc 

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.850
 ok software windows enterprise system 

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.610
 integrators we also have they want 

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:36.760
 java user group this java java community 

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:38.470
 went to giacometti darjeeling 

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.030
 10 and ford 

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:45.230
 if you look at the jakarta 

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:50.690
 globe king of members of the left side 

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:56.600
 we have with the usual suspects sodat 

00:23:50.690 --> 00:24:00.950
 companies this java me enterprise saddle 

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:03.260

 red hat to thurso nicetoile smaller 

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:08.390
 companies like paillard anatomy tribe 

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:12.460
 cause it's also one of the 

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:17.240
 value of our open source iko system to 

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:20.210
 big x12 big big fish is with the 

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:26.270
 smaller fishes to make their work 

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:30.100
 together to participate side and we have 

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:30.100
 london java community for example 

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:39.250
 pivotal is a member because if you think 

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:48.050
 about spring most of the spring hill

 house of jamaica carta specifications n 

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:52.970
 another example louis admitted or me do 

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:56.470
 is being so that the japanese 

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:56.470
 bankanywhere working with her 

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:05.060
 you are people in london and there are 

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.920
 using lot except cavalli and they want to 

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:10.190
 participate to jakarta and because they 

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:13.640
 want twinject it's requirements and i 

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:18.530
 want you to include it's hard and shaun 

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:21.640
