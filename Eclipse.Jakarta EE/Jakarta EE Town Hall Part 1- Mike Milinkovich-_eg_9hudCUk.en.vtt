a spec and I don't really think that's
 

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
a spec and I don't really think that's

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:34.990 align:start position:0%
it that those two criteria are important
 

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.010 align:start position:0%
it that those two criteria are important
you<00:11:35.350><c> know</c><00:11:35.470><c> you</c><00:11:36.070><c> can</c><00:11:36.820><c> build</c><00:11:37.060><c> it</c><00:11:37.210><c> and</c><00:11:37.390><c> that</c>

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:38.020 align:start position:0%
you know you can build it and that
 

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know you can build it and that
people<00:11:38.320><c> care</c><00:11:40.530><c> no</c><00:11:41.530><c> more</c><00:11:41.710><c> spec</c><00:11:42.010><c> lead</c>

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:42.970 align:start position:0%
people care no more spec lead
 

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
people care no more spec lead
so<00:11:43.240><c> the</c><00:11:43.360><c> JCP</c><00:11:43.810><c> process</c><00:11:44.290><c> for</c><00:11:44.530><c> those</c><00:11:44.850><c> that</c><00:11:45.850><c> know</c>

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:46.390 align:start position:0%
so the JCP process for those that know
 

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.450 align:start position:0%
so the JCP process for those that know
it<00:11:46.510><c> well</c><00:11:46.720><c> knows</c><00:11:47.110><c> that</c><00:11:47.350><c> there's</c><00:11:47.590><c> the</c><00:11:48.160><c> way</c><00:11:48.310><c> that</c>

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:48.460 align:start position:0%
it well knows that there's the way that
 

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
it well knows that there's the way that
the<00:11:49.000><c> process</c><00:11:49.270><c> works</c><00:11:49.750><c> is</c><00:11:50.080><c> that</c><00:11:50.260><c> there's</c><00:11:50.530><c> a</c><00:11:50.620><c> each</c>

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:50.830 align:start position:0%
the process works is that there's a each
 

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
the process works is that there's a each
spec<00:11:51.280><c> has</c><00:11:51.460><c> a</c><00:11:51.520><c> spec</c><00:11:51.970><c> lead</c><00:11:52.240><c> which</c><00:11:52.630><c> is</c><00:11:52.780><c> a</c><00:11:52.810><c> company</c>

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.170 align:start position:0%
spec has a spec lead which is a company

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:01.420 align:start position:0%
the spec lead and then spec need license
 

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%

gonna run the specs as open-source

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:26.920 align:start position:0%

the spec process what you'll see is that

the spec process what you'll see is that
