 pc and target from pain to best practice 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.390
 in their electrical problems and 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:50.040
 Solutions europe gets well on the train rating 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:52.980
 infrastructure for our project to des 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.170
 turning agenda wants to be looking like the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.330
 first of all the way we look in holyhead 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:04.239
 structured products for dz from the end of July 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:08.770

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.950
 in particles like walking advocacy twitter 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.720
 and just one world one project project

 the penaltys using it repositories and 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.430
 finally after we have done to set up 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:41.880
 where we can set up the project in 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:45.910
 the picture fits roger reddig okay so 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.190
 get here is taiko and may the witch 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.860
 ernstings on-site infrastructure day 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.020
 private car matte mayor testing 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.680
 and integrate world of the cribs 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:04.240
 technologies but the questions 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:07.320
 main problem set up system works and of 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.320
 course 11 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.039
 [Music] 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.660
 It is not one on the way to the top 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.930
 jobs 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:35.800
 because we all have very different nice 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:49.380
 that's ok go on some compilation of 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:49.380
 answers of the workers and the context of 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.840
 project are using it infrastructure for 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:02.500
 the largest unit and remain i 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.489
 work on is called the satellite which is 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.920
 great place to work for developing model 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:13.440
 based systems engineering applications 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:20.080
 to make it simple by modeling and 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:34.260
 developing applications models of 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:36.970
 project based research focus money 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.799
 projects for students as well 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.780
 master studies july is about project 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.280
 which is not the wall project 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.829
 that can independent research 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:55.860
 because as well as products project manager 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:55.860
 engineers heart and this difference 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:28.060
 june fortis projects and meet with the 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:29.810
 weary head of project project which 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.360
 contains 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:41.960
 Often new wave a setup will be masters at 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:45.360
 the top level in more clean tech world 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:05:01.560
 to the holidays platform which wants 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:05:03.780
 The penaltys collected from the 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:09.500
 is harry to define the product for 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:13.880
 application and used look at one of our 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.880
 plugins like can just add water 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:26.870
 masterplan thats a better plugins 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.870
 look like you think project 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.760
 heiko weber and setup hughes inc 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:47.580
 tyco answer is herbs for plugins fdp 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:53.580
 some of them but some of you 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.580
 may need some nice configuration as well

 jenkins show of the entertainer 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:35.350
 because they are freezing cold then like on the 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:38.140
 set up amount platform as if it had 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.250
 the tourist you are the temporary me 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:07:12.370
 think you have to come the user

 project director scott 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:24.840
 can use the second way of getting the 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:28.169
 seas in a picture like canon oslo the 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.539
 enemies pose tories we can just say okay 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:33.539
 just get your plugins from this update

 at least that's what they do 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:47.310
 used for developing the basic i just a

 game features trumpet repositories 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.500
 without having annie and sourcecode 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:08:11.690
 continue because of moment in the word of having 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:16.710
 to maintain the day's platform as well 

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:20.729
 car and testing and what are you watching 

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:24.690
 set the property of the day to set up 

00:08:20.729 --> 00:08:26.389
 then put on bradley manning in 

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:31.250
 hettersroth and there are star 

00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:31.250
 cooperation on the time we can take 

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:37.979
 something i said i continue ding is the 

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.820
 first test video often ends with handle and 

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:41.820
 jenkins level 

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:45.440
 we want the playoffs the wave ii of 

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:49.920
 Monaco again and stop the ex 

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:52.680
 terrorist lot of time they can dance the 

00:08:49.920 --> 00:09:08.120
 skin lux and jenkins when the outside 

00:08:52.680 --> 00:09:11.520
 jacko code coverage of the training camp 

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:15.750

 it was very important thing that we had 

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:54.019
 with external the penaltys be made in 

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:59.089
 some cases you get the following 

00:09:54.019 --> 00:10:05.899
 fact start-up days platform james ensor 

00:09:59.089 --> 00:10:09.730

 projects records private customers series 

00:10:46.249 --> 00:10:53.720
 project i can not be different now 

00:10:49.819 --> 00:11:03.800
 Law of project project project be 

00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:05.050

 ducks fists here in an interview 

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:20.860
 repository of widge act the old

 project can dance factory features 

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:29.749
 display continue the cherry long to get 

00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:31.910
 our dependence project basica you in the 

00:11:29.749 --> 00:11:34.660
 tank platform never wants to reference it 

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:46.180
 it the touri posse torri 

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:49.329
 laura defect if you in the we 

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:51.819
 discovered one way to the sausage

 fear would have to be very young 

00:11:51.819 --> 00:11:58.720
 development board and what i fire to day 

00:11:55.269 --> 00:12:05.620
 time and what ever you make me picture 

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:10.790
 One day's platform is on the roll

 directly is worked for one with brunch 

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:20.320
 basic we actually heart shape car industry 

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:24.370
 studios bit of context here is how we 

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.810
 have set up it's based on summit project 

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:28.750
 development braunschweig 

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:31.560
 most of the work and it's time to 

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:34.300
 major release again under integration 

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.000
 bvi duo manual testing and keep our 

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:40.839
 separated close said fred from jupiter 

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.050
 development because then if the 

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:50.529
 testing and bugfixing poetry can just 

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:54.880
 the master and development for 

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:57.850
 difference is that remains different 

00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.550
 ways to configure jobs for example and 

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:07.680
 master wants to build by mac developer 

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:12.700
 and the jobs are just come and go away 

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:15.330
 we can have many of them is the 

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.650
 question is not an original example here 

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:30.880
 passwords displays property and get 

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:36.760
 some great feedback like project example 

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:39.670
 jobs basic resources target for the

 Station's crew to be over is up to date 

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:47.770
 The penaltys ends up waste resort picture 

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:51.550
 as well as on development board and avery 

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:54.310
 finish the picture donate the jobs 

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:56.770
 should the theory of the overall choir losses 

00:14:54.310 --> 00:15:08.709
 development picture-interview the project 

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:24.990
 development develops download shop

 releases from the differential is july in 

00:16:50.870 --> 00:17:20.390
 Arabidopsis exercises again and if 

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:23.209
 the zdh can refinery setup new project 

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:26.620
 and infrastructure jessica woodworth 

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:41.510
 then it's like yeast template project 

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:52.990
 project to set up artist to some of the 

00:17:41.510 --> 00:18:01.990
