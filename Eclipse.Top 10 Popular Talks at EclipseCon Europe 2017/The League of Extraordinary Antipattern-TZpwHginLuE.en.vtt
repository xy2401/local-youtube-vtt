 [Music] 

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.560
 also considerably for program change 

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:29.600
 would not go but while the tail risk 

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:36.690
 office of data base could protect

 if the dredger helper opens it up 

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:31.459
 the program 

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:41.230
 these cost the dredge users and events 

00:15:31.459 --> 00:16:20.720
