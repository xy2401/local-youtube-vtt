The JUnit framework is one of the most valuable skills a developer can learn to achieve that. JUnit 4.0 was first released over a decade ago after the introduction of annotations in Java 5. The world of Java and testing has evolved a lot since then. To take advantage of the new features like lambda expressions in Java 8 and to support the advanced testing needs, JUnit 5 is emerging as the next generation test framework and is expected to be released during Q3 2017. Eclipse is embracing it by integrating the new features provided by JUnit 5 in its tooling support.\n\nIn this session, I will demo how to get started with JUnit 5 in Eclipse and how the new features in JUnit 5 blend with the existing functionality in Eclipse. Some of the features from JUnit 5 that you will see in action include:     Custom display names     Custom composed annotations     Lambda expressions for assertions and assumptions     Grouping assertions     Nested tests     Dependency injection for constructors and methods     Dynamic tests and containers     Implementing tests via interface default methods\n\nThis session is not intended to provide a deep dive into JUnit 5.

This talk will help you unleash this power and help you debug your Java code like a pro. The talk will also cover the new debugging features coming with Eclipse 4.8 (code name Oxygen, released last June). So, even if you're an experienced Java programmer, you will learn some tips and tricks.\n\nThis talk will be full of live debugging sessions on various applications and of many kinds. Among others, you will see the following concepts in action:     All about breakpoints: conditional, method, hit counts, trigger (new in Oxygen), traces (new in Oxygen)     Local and remote debugging: local debugging is business as usual, but you will learn how to debug an application while it's running on a remote server.     Inspect and watch Java expressions: learn how to see value and watch complex expressions that may not be in your code to better understand what is going on.     Object details formatters: will explain how to override the toString() method of a class you don't own for your debugging purpose.

Using Tycho and Maven in your build infrastructure can be very beneficial, but first it needs to be set up. In fact, this is the real challenge. Unfortunately, there is no real state-of-the-art or best practice about how to use this technology. Particularly, only little documentation exists. Most likely this is a consequence of everyone\u2019s individual project requirements and thus not allowing for the one ultimate answer. Nevertheless, when crawling through forums and mailing lists you can easily find other Eclipse fellows facing quite similar issues as you do. Still the answers to these common questions are rare. In this talk, we provide some of the common answers we came across in context of our project Virtual Satellite. Our talk helps you to find an easy start with Tycho.\n\nVirtual Satellite is a framework based on Eclipse. The framework is used to develop different spacecraft related applications used productively in projects and departments. In addition, it serves as a basis for PhD and master theses which focus on exploring innovative approaches. To support both cases, we established a build infrastructure to build and test the Virtual Satellite framework and depending projects.\n\nIn the beginning of the talk, we describe how we initially set up Tycho for the framework. For that purpose, we explain, for example, how we use a p2 server to cache external dependencies of the Eclipse project and how it is used in the target platform definition. We also present best practices on using test fragments and defining a product that is finally deployed to another p2 repository. This setup is used for most of our projects and could be suitable as a starting point for your next one as well.\n\nAs an advanced use case, we explain how we use Tycho in the applications depending on the framework. An application`s target platform is based on a specific framework version. This dependency can raise issues on version management and easily break Tycho builds. We show how we solved the issues with the help of development, integration and release builds. Particularly, we explain how it simplified setting up new Tycho based projects using the Virtual Satellite framework.\n\nSpeaker(s):\nSascha M\u00fcller (DLR)", "categories": ["Science & Technology"], "tags": [], "subtitles": {}, "automatic_captions": {}, "duration": 1194, "age_limit": 0, "annotations": null, "chapters": null, "webpage_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ycwjX6z_3g", "view_count": 1624, "like_count": 9, "dislike_count": 1, "average_rating": 4.5999999, "is_live": null, "start_time": null, "end_time": null, "series": null, "season_number": null, "episode_number": null, "track": null, "artist": null, "album": null, "release_date": null, "release_year": null, "extractor": "youtube", "webpage_url_basename": "9ycwjX6z_3g", "extractor_key": "Youtube", "n_entries": 10, "playlist": "Top 10 Popular Talks at EclipseCon Europe 2017", "playlist_id": "PLy7t4z5SYNaSxZRV1cKJDm341g3b8X7qs", "playlist_title": "Top 10 Popular Talks at EclipseCon Europe 2017", "playlist_uploader": "Eclipse Foundation", "playlist_uploader_id": "EclipseFdn", "playlist_index": 7, "thumbnails": [{"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ycwjX6z_3g/maxresdefault.jpg", "id": "0"}], "display_id": "9ycwjX6z_3g", "requested_subtitles": null, "format": "247 - 1280x720 (DASH video)+251 - audio only (DASH audio)", "format_id": "247+251", "width": 1280, "height": 720, "resolution": null, "fps": 25, "vcodec": "vp9", "vbr": null, "stretched_ratio": null, "acodec": "opus", "abr": 160, "ext": "webm", "fulltitle": "About Tycho, Maven, p2 and Target-Platforms: From Pain to Best Practice", "_filename": "About Tycho, Maven, p2 and Target-Platforms - From Pain to Best Practice-9ycwjX6z_3g.webm"}

We'll review some common packaging, technical and licensing FAQs for the various builds available.

The Eclipse Java IDE provides many debugging tools and views for users to debug effectively and efficiently. Eclipse users spend a lot of time in debugging code and every new debugging feature in Eclipse helps the users to be productive in fixing bugs. Debugging in Eclipse Platform and JDT is continuously evolving to provide tooling which can help users debug complex scenarios and spend less time in routine tasks.\n\nI will talk about some exciting new features coming up in Photon (4.8) like :\n\u2022 Provision of Launch Configuration templates under Friend of Eclipse Enhancement Program (FEEP)\n\u2022 Provision of advanced source lookup which provides correct source lookup when runtime classpath is not fully known in advance\n\u2022 Improved support for Lambda debugging\n\nI will demonstrate some new concepts added in Oxygen (4.7) like:\n\u2022 Trigger points\n\u2022 Launch Group\n\u2022 Return value after Step operation\n\nI will also show few debugging Tips & Tricks like:\n\u2022 Run to Line\n\u2022 Step Filters\n\u2022 Smart Step Into\n\nJoin the session and learn new debugging tricks in Eclipse.", "categories": ["Science & Technology"], "tags": [], "subtitles": {}, "automatic_captions": {}, "duration": 2109, "age_limit": 0, "annotations": null, "chapters": null, "webpage_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRO8TEybCDE", "view_count": 1637, "like_count": 6, "dislike_count": 0, "average_rating": 5.0, "is_live": null, "start_time": null, "end_time": null, "series": null, "season_number": null, "episode_number": null, "track": null, "artist": null, "album": null, "release_date": null, "release_year": null, "extractor": "youtube", "webpage_url_basename": "SRO8TEybCDE", "extractor_key": "Youtube", "n_entries": 10, "playlist": "Top 10 Popular Talks at EclipseCon Europe 2017", "playlist_id": "PLy7t4z5SYNaSxZRV1cKJDm341g3b8X7qs", "playlist_title": "Top 10 Popular Talks at EclipseCon Europe 2017", "playlist_uploader": "Eclipse Foundation", "playlist_uploader_id": "EclipseFdn", "playlist_index": 10, "thumbnails": [{"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SRO8TEybCDE/maxresdefault.jpg", "id": "0"}], "display_id": "SRO8TEybCDE", "requested_subtitles": null, "format": "247 - 1280x720 (DASH video)+140 - audio only (DASH audio)", "format_id": "247+140", "width": 1280, "height": 720, "resolution": null, "fps": 25, "vcodec": "vp9", "vbr": null, "stretched_ratio": null, "acodec": "mp4a.40.2", "abr": 128, "ext": "webm", "fulltitle": "Productive debugging with Eclipse Photon", "_filename": "Productive debugging with Eclipse Photon-SRO8TEybCDE.webm"}
