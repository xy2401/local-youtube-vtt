IMPORTING AN ECLIPSE PROJECT

00:00:06.153 --> 00:00:08.250
Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA basics.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.716
We're going to import
a new Eclipse project into IntelliJ IDEA.

00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:16.600
I've already created the project,
so I'll select 'Import Project'

00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:21.695
and I'll select my project
jboss-as-kitchensink.

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:23.600
I'll open that up

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.330
and the wizard will guide me
through the process.

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:32.950
We support importing an Eclipse model,
so we'll select that and click 'Next'.

00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:34.966
There are a few options to choose from.

00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:40.163
You'll select your directory here,
we can refine that if it's a subdirectory

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.608
and you can add a module file
near the classpath.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.350
It can be either an idea (directory based)
or an ipr (file based) project format.

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:57.433
Finally, we can create a link
between IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse

00:00:57.503 --> 00:01:02.066
so, if you have team members
using Eclipse and you use IntelliJ IDEA,

00:01:02.253 --> 00:01:05.628
you can link those two together
so that, whenever you add a module,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.586
that'll create a new Eclipse project
and viceversa.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.095
It'll keep those in synch
if we add this link here.

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:17.983
We can add a regular expression or pattern
to detect certain test sources

00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:20.846
and so it'll identify those
if we have any.

00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:24.811
We'll click 'Next' and select
the Eclipse projects to import.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.705
Each Eclipse project will correspond
to an IntelliJ IDEA module.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:35.535
To reload the project after importing it,
we can select 'Open Project Structure'

00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:40.306
to configure our project structure
so we'll click 'Next' and select the JDK.

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:44.630
I'll just use 1.6 here.
We'll wait for it to start up

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:51.113
and we'll configure our project structure
by adding sources, paths and dependencies.

00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:54.325
Finally, we’ll click
‘Apply’ and then ‘OK’.

00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:58.193
Our Eclipse project
is now imported into IntelliJ IDEA

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:03.338
with one additional IDEA module file
next to the corresponding project file.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.066
That's it. Thanks for watching
and develop with pleasure!

00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:12.300
THANKS FOR WATCHING!
