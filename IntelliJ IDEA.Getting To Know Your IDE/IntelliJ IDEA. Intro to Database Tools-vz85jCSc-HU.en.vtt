INTRO TO DATABASE TOOLS

00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:07.100
IntelliJ IDEA has
some handy database tools

00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:10.766
for working with databases
from right inside your IDE.

00:00:10.936 --> 00:00:16.831
We’re going to give you tips for using
the database tools in IntelliJ IDEA.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.148
First you'll need to add a new data source
via our Database tool window.

00:00:24.963 --> 00:00:30.266
Here you can add a new data source
from a number of providers.

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:33.166
Here we’ll choose a SQLite database.

00:00:33.253 --> 00:00:35.951
If we have a driver already installed,

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:40.300
we'll be able to simply add that
without any further configuration.

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:44.676
I'll need to specify the database file,
so, if I have a database dump,

00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:50.700
I can import that directly,
test the connection to see that it works,

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:55.733
and apply to see
what the database looks like.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.100
IntelliJ IDEA will import
the database schema.

00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:04.338
On the right side
in the database tool window...

00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:07.800
if you expand some of the nodes,

00:01:08.128 --> 00:01:11.443
you'll see a number of columns
inside these tables

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.633
but this isn't very helpful.

00:01:13.816 --> 00:01:16.833
If you’d like to view the schema visually,

00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:20.716
you can press Ctrl+Shift+U
to show the visualization

00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:25.700
and you'll see
how tables are related to each other

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:27.703
by the foreign key here.

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:32.430
You can also navigate any of the tables
by using your navigation keys.

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:35.110
You can jump to its source
and then press it again

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.151
to open up a table.

00:01:37.643 --> 00:01:41.733
If you want to reform a query
against some tables in this database,

00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:46.776
you can open up the console window
and write some SQL.

00:01:50.468 --> 00:01:55.101
From the console window, you'll get
code completion and static analysis

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.143
for whichever dialect
of SQL you're using.

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:04.776
In the join condition, it'll offer
to autocomplete the foreign key for me.

00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:08.318
I can just select that
and it'll automatically complete it.

00:02:08.546 --> 00:02:12.058
I can execute this query
by pressing Ctrl+Enter.

00:02:12.658 --> 00:02:18.933
Inside the result window, you'll see
all the results for the query we just ran.

00:02:19.718 --> 00:02:24.845
THANKS FOR WATCHING!
