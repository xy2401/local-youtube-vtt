00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.929
In this screencast we're going to show the
basics of navigation in IntelliJ IDEA

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.633
This is the default setup when you start
IntelliJ IDEA

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.309
Note that you have some navigation hints here,
and we'll see some of these in action

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.509
IntelliJ IDEA has a navigation bar at the

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:27.320
top, a series of tool window buttons along
the edges which let you open a window, the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.829
main project window on the left, which you
can navigate using the mouse, the keyboard,

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.559
or even typing to search for something.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.609
When you open a file, the editor opens the
file and displays a tab.

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.819
Each new file has a new tab.

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.100
The editor also shows a breadcrumb trail to
show where you are in the file

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.809
We can use these mechanisms to navigate in

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.620
IntelliJ IDEA, but all of these things take
up valuable screen space which we'd prefer

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.739
to use for showing code.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.680
Let's get set up with the advanced mode of
using IntelliJ IDEA, which relies on just

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.680
keyboard shortcuts

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.119
First, lets turn off the breadcrumbs.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.159
We can do this using the settings window by
searching for breadcrumbs and turning them

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.689
off, you can see they're no longer shown at
the bottom of the editor.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.220
But there's a simpler way to change a setting.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.970
We can use Shift Ctrl A or Shift Cmd A to
find an action, and type the name of the setting.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.909
To turn off tabs, type tab and set tab placement
to None.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.850
We can also turn off the navigation bar and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.250
the tool window buttons this way.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.649
Finally, to get the most screen space for

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.499
the editor we use Shift Ctrl F12 or Shift
Cmd F12 to hide all the side windows and expand

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:56.039
the editor

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.200
How do we move around now?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.829
With a set of keyboard shortcuts.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.969
There are a lot of different ways to move
around, we can use the ones that are most

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:04.969
useful to us

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:13.790
Firstly, Alt plus a number, or Cmd plus a
number, opens up the tool windows.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.620
For example, Alt + 1 for the project window,
Alt + 9 for the VCS window.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.110
Escape moves the focus from that window back
to the editor, and of course we can use shift

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.290
Ctrl F12 again to hide the windows.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.170
If a window doesn't have a number, or we forget

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.120
what it is, we can use Ctrl E or Cmd E to
bring up the recent files list, which also

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.870
shows all the available windows.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.790
Like all IntelliJ IDEA windows, typing here
allows us to search.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.810
We can use the recent files window to quickly

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.750
move to a file we've been to lately, and we
can even use CamelCase to search these files

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.099
for the one we want.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.230
Shift Ctrl E or Shift Cmd E brings up a list

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.970
of recent locations - This isn't just a file
but a location within a file, so we can navigate

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.480
directly to a recent snippet of code

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.000
Often we know the exact name of the class
we want to open, we can use Ctrl N or Cmd O

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.930
to open a search for classes.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.540
We could type the name of the class in here
until just the option we want is available,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:34.689
or we can use camel case or even partial class
names to locate a class that matches.

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.409
If we want to open a file that isn't a Java
class, we can use Shift Ctrl N or

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:45.569
Shift Cmd O to navigate to a file.

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:52.219
With classes or files we can type a colon
followed by a line number and we can go straight

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.690
to that line in the file.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.450
If we know the name of the method we want,

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:05.540
we can use navigate to symbol, Shift Ctrl
Alt N or Alt Cmd O and type the method name.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.790
Again, camel case and partial names are supported.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.280
We can also add a class&nbsp; name or partial
class name to search for symbols within a

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.600
specific namespace

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.110
Once we're inside the code, we can navigate
to a declaration using Ctrl B or Cmd B.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.760
We can also easily navigate back to where
we cam from using Ctrl Alt Left or Cmd Alt left arrow.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.750
We can navigate forward using Ctrl Alt Right
or Cmd Alt right arrow.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.660
If we're working with interfaces, navigating

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.440
to the declaration might not be that useful.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.860
We can use ctrl alt b or alt cmd b to navigate
to an implementation.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.860
If there's just one implementation, we'll
move straight to that implementation.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.730
If there's more than one, we see a list like
this and we can select the one we want.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.730
Let's use navigate to declaration to go to

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.470
the declaration that uses the interface.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.950
If we move the caret onto the interface name,
we can use Alt F7 to find the usages of this

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:06.130
interface, which lists everywhere that calls
methods on the interface as well as implementation

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.190
of the interface.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:15.080
This can be another useful way to navigate
to relevant classes from the code that uses them.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.580
If we're doing test driven development we

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.840
may find another method of navigation helpful.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:27.000
If we're inside a test class and press shift
Ctrl T, or Shift Cmd T, we will move into

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.180
the class that the test is testing.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.680
If we're in a class and we want to move to
the test, or to see if it has a test, we can

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:42.490
use the same key combination to see the tests
and select one, or even create a new test.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.400
If all this is a bit too much to remember,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:52.150
there's a simple shortcut for everything - double
tap shift and we get the search everywhere box.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.780
This lists the recent files by default, and
we can optionally narrow down our search choices

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.780
if we want to.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.070
Type anything in there and it will give a
list of files, actions, classes, symbols,

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.450
and settings.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:08.130
Use forward slash to see the commands, selecting
one of these will give a list of appropriate options.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.700
If you find there's something you search for

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.330
fairly frequently that doesn't easily show
up in the results, you could of course, create

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.160
a keyboard shortcut for it.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.340
But you can also add an abbreviation, or keyword,
to make it easier to find.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:32.210
Search for the action in the keymap, press
enter to bring up the menu on the item, select

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.890
Add Abbreviation, and type the keyword you
want to use in the search.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.540
Then, when you double tap shift to bring up
the search, you can type this abbreviation

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.110
and the action should be the first item in
the list.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.120
Finally, there's one last area where keyboard

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.280
shortcuts can be much quicker than using the
navigation bar.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.160
We can run anything from anywhere inside the
IDE by double tapping ctrl.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.430
This brings up a list of recently run tests
or applications, and we can type the name

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.960
of any run configuration to find it and run
it.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.210
This is a fast way to start a test or service
without having to navigate to the file itself

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.860
or use the navigation bar.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.860
Ctrl and F2 or Cmd F2 brings up a list of
processes we can stop

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:25.530
or we can press Ctrl F2 a second time to stop all processes

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.310
In summary, the easiest way to navigation
around IntelliJ IDEA is using the keyboard.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.240
This is much faster than using the mouse,
and allows us to free up valuable screen space

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.580
for the code we're working on.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.440
Thanks for watching!
