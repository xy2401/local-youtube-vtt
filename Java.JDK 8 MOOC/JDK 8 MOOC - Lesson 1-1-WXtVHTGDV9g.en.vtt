[music]

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:12.879
 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.099
Hello and welcome to this massive

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.320
open online course on JDK 8.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.800
In this course we're going to be looking
at some of the new features that have been

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.390
included

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.810
in JDK 8 and the Java programming language

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.290
and Java libraries, which allow you to
take a more functional approach

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.489
when developing applications. This will
use

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.350
Lambda expressions the streams API. My
name is on Simon Ritter,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.010
Java Technology Evangelist,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.150
and I will be guiding you through the 3 weekly
lessons that we have

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:55.460
for this course. The aim of this course

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.100
is to give you an idea about how you
can use

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.040
Lambda expressions, so we'll talk about
various aspects of those

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.630
Lambda expressions in terms of the syntax; where
you can use them; how you can use and so on.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.979
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.520
Then we'll talk about the Streams API 
and how

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.100
they can use Lambda expressions
extensively to give you a more

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.030
functional style of

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.049
programming using JDK 8. What this gives
you

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.180
when you understand how to use these
correctly, is a

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.549
much better way of solving a lot of common
problems

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.140
in terms of how we process data,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.570
how we process collections data. It gives
you much more concise

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.229
more flexible way of doing that, so the code
becomes

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.220
easier to read, easier to understand, and
easier to maintain.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.680
One the other big advantages in this is

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.189
the fact that you can now much more
easily

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.280
take advantage of multiple core
processors and,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.770
if your machine has more multiple processors, then

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.750
the parallel execution code could be
made much, much simpler

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.219
using this type of syntax.

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.410
Let's start with lesson 1, and in this
lesson

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.569
we're going to look at Lambda
expressions. The agenda for this lesson

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.040
is firstly we'll start talking about why

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.720
we need to add Lambda expressions to Java.
Java is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.080
twenty-years-old and we been very
happily programming for those last 20

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.530
years, last

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.819
nineteen years since JDK 8 is about a year

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.650
since it was released, so we've been
using them Java for

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.519
a good nineteen years without Lambda
expressions, so why do we need to add

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.690
at this point in time?

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.150
We need to understand the syntax of

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.579
Lambda expressions, so we'll cover that in
some detail and then

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.299
we'll look at places where you can
actually use Lambda expressions

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.329
and this is, essentially, wherever you can
use a

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.329
function interface. So we'll describe
what functional interfaces are,

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.540
their definition, how you use them and so on.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.560
We'll move from there

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.590
to looking at some of the new
functional interfaces that have been

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.450
included

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.090
in the java.util.function package and these

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.090
are very relevant when we start talking
about streams

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.790
in lesson two because they are used
extensively

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.650
in conjunction with streams. One of the
other things that we've included in JDK 8

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.750
around Lambda expressions

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.170
is a shorthand way of creating certain
types of Lambda

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.069
expressions, where you're using just calls
to a particular method

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.500
or using a constructor, so these are
method and constructor references

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.489
and we'll explain the three different
situations we can use those and

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.639
again the syntax and the way those work.
There are some

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.470
quite, not complicated rules, but there
are some rules that you need to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.500
understand

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.700
about how you can reference variables
from the surrounding scope

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.410
in Lambda expression. We'll cover
that in some detail,

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.840
we'll talk about what the rules are, how
you can use things and also

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.290
how the compiler can actually help
you certain situations.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.840
In the last part of this lesson we'll
look at some of the new methods that

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.360
have been added to the existing

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.959
JDK 8 libraries outside the streams API

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.950
where you can use Lambda expressions;
some of the really useful things you

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.630
can do

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:33.080
for collections and also for things
like logging.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.770
We'll start then with part one of Lesson one about

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:43.690
why does Java need Lambda expressions?
Now I mentioned

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.450
that what this allows you to do is to
simplify

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.700
how you can take advantage of multicore

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.750
processors and multiple processors.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.410
If you look at the history of Java what
you'll find is that right from the very

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.250
beginning

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.660
Java had the concept of

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.380
being able to support multiple streams of
execution,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.350
multiple threads of execution.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.920
In JDK 1.0 you had a java.lang.thread class,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.970
which allows you to create a separate
thread. You could define

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.600
through the use of something like a runnable
what the code was

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.270
you want to execute within that thread.
That was great because it meant that it

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.320
was very simple

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.410
to create multiple threads that could do
things potentially in parallel.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.390
The problem that we had with that

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.370
was when you had several threads all
which wanted to work together

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.600
if they were working separately that was
no issue once you want threads to work

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.290
together

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.530
to share data and to be able to
coordinate

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.770
their activities, to certain points in
time

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.970
then you quite restricted in what you
can do with the thread.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.900
There are essentially four methods in the
thread class

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.640
that allow you to do that, there is sleep,
interrupt,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.320
wait and notify.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.890
Writing code that has multiple threads
working together

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.240
just using those APIs is actually
very difficult.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.910
What we wanted to do was to simplify that.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.050
In JDK 5.0 we introduced

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.140
the concurrency utilities (this was JSR
166,

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.860
Java specification request 166).

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.250
What this provided you with was
quite a big

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.580
toolbox of new classes

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.069
and API's that made this coordination

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:43.330
of multiple threads simpler. We
introduced

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.960
the kind of concepts that people who've
done multi-threaded programming in

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.470
other languages on other platforms
already used to.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.479
Things like a Semaphore class, things
like new mutexes,

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.039
read/write locks, atomic operations; all of

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.539
those types of things that people were
familiar with and getting used to

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:06.139
create better code in terms of
multi-threading.

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:09.289
In JDK 6

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:14.150
we had a few more advanced features
things like Phasers which was just

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.289
another way of having

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:18.580
multiple threads all working seem simultaneously

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.479
and then arriving at a particular point
in time so they could deliver a particular set of

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:23.180
results.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.680
In JDK 7

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.550
we had another attempt at making life
easier for writing

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.280
multi-threaded code and code that ran in
parallel. We introduced

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.310
the fork-join framework. What this gives
you

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.340
is the ability to take a single task
which can be broken down into

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.090
multiple sub tasks and have that happen
recursively

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.509
until you get to a small enough task
that could be handled by single thread.

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:55.550
The framework takes care all creating a
pool of threads to use,

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.740
it takes care all allocating various
tasks to

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.770
the different queues associated with those

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:07.009
threads and then it takes care of
gathering all the results together once

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:07.569
the

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:12.139
queues have been processed and delivering the final
result. So that was good,

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:15.789
but it still had the drawback that it required
quite a lot of

00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:19.099
boilerplate code to use that effectively.

00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:22.740
For JDK 8

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.940
we sat down and thought, well we want to add
more features, but we want to make it easier

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.590
still

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.760
for people to write parallel code. At
this point we realized

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.860
that we couldn't just add more APIs in
classes to standard

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.550
class libraries. In order to make life
easier for developers,

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.730
we had to make some changes to the
language syntax that

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.350
we could then use in conjunction with
new API's

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.390
to make this simpler. This is what

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.180
the Lambda expression syntax and project
Lambdas

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.930
is all about. So this is why we wanted to
add Lambdas.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.890
Primarily to make life easier for you as
developers

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.019
to write parallel code that could work

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:12.730
in simple way.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.910
Let's have a look act a sample piece of
code

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.700
and this is the kind code we were
writing lot

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.180
in Java. What we have here is

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.210
a collection of data, in this case it's a
collection

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.240
of records about students who take
exams over

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.370
various years. What we want to extract
from this information

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.620
is what was the highest score

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.860
that any student got, who graduated

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.900
in the year 2011. We can see here

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.260
do we've got fairly simple piece of code. What
I've done

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.620
is I've got my collection of students and
then

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.430
I create a variable called highest score.
I've assigned that an initial value of zero,

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.760
so that we can update that as we find
higher scores.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.590
Then we use the

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:11.010
very common way we do things in Java
which is we iterate.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.030
Java is an imperative language,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.280
that means that we have sequences of commands,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.390
which can manipulate variables

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.850
to update things and process data,

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.310
as we want it. In this case we want to
iterate

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.870
over the collection of students so we
look at each student in turn

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.440
looking at their graduation year and
looking at their score.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.390
We use the more modern foreach
syntax for this loop.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.780
This in itself hides some of the
details

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.080
because in this case what we'll actually
have to do

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.620
is to extract the iterator from the
collection students

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.740
and then we're going to have to repeatedly
get

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.560
elements from that iterator so we
actually moved through the collection

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.890
until there are no more elements left.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.500
The syntax of that for statement is actually
a bit more complicated

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.730
we just using shorthand which simplifies
it in terms of our

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.019
code.

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:13.509
As we move through the collection of
students we look at each record

00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:16.889
we can compare the graduation year

00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:21.809
of that student to 2011. If they graduated in
that year, which is

00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:25.419
the year we're interested in, then we look
at their score.

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:30.970
We compare the score of that student
against out current highest score.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.980
If the student has a higher score than

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.529
that number, then we assign the

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:41.829
value of our highest score, the value we're
recording

00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:44.899
to whatever that student got in their
exam.

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:48.410
At the end of this, what we're going to have

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:52.879
is the highest score any student got in
the year 2011.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:56.350
We've solved the problem. There is absolutely
nothing wrong

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.429
functionally with what we doing in this
code.

00:11:59.429 --> 00:12:04.220
The functionality works perfectly. The
problem

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.769
is in terms of how we would want to

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:11.999
process that if we want to take
advantage of multiple cores and multiple

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:12.989
processors.

00:12:12.989 --> 00:12:17.160
By having our loop

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.539
here what we're doing is we're
controlling iteration.

00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:23.739
We're defining through our loop the order

00:12:23.739 --> 00:12:27.649
in which the elements of that collection
are going to be processed.

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:31.369
That means that we in effect have a
contract between

00:12:31.369 --> 00:12:35.869
our code and the compiler and the runtime
that states the order they will be

00:12:35.869 --> 00:12:36.489
processed.

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:40.970
Although it doesn't actually matter
in this case

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.619
if we were doing other things which
which did require

00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:50.109
that order to be maintained we couldn't
break it up into parallel operations

00:12:50.109 --> 00:12:54.619
because breaking it up and parallel
operations we would introduce

00:12:54.619 --> 00:12:57.759
non-deterministic behaviour because different
threads could execute at different

00:12:57.759 --> 00:13:01.819
times, they could be looking at different
pieces data and so we may not always get

00:13:01.819 --> 00:13:02.859
the same result.

00:13:02.859 --> 00:13:07.119
We have control over the situation

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:11.829
which means that out code is inherently
serial. We start at the beginning of the

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:12.480
collection and

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.320
we move to the end to the collection.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.710
The other problem we have is even if we
were to

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.290
rewrite our loop and trying to avoid
using loop explicitly

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.680
we still have a variable highestScore

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.250
and this is mutable state.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.470
Having a variable that we can change and
if we would have multiple threads

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.060
we would still have problems because
it's not thread-safe

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.210
multiple threads could be updating that
variable at the same

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:44.310
time and overwrite the changes which
are made by other threads.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.470
We would need to introduce locking to
prevent multiple threads from accessing

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.800
it

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.120
at the same time and that would add more work to our

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.610
application code. Right now we have
good works but it's not

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.510
good in terms multi-threading and
parallel execution.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.110
Let's take the same code

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:09.240
and rewrite its using a more functional
approach.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.490
Now we're going to talk about functional
programming

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:16.850
a lot more in lesson two, at the beginning of
that lesson, but for now you can think

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.290
of

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.740
a more functional approach as being
simply the ability to chain together

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.020
method calls to have things execute one after
the other.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.490
Now what we're doing is we're taking
a collection of students

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:34.750
and not using an explicit loop. Now we're passing in
the collection of students

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:39.190
records to a filter method. The filter
method

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.340
is told how to do filtering

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.180
using a Predicate interface. The Predicate interface

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.700
has a single method and we use an anonymous
inner class

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.700
to define what that method is going
to do.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.070
In this case it's a method called op, that
takes a student as a parameter and

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.380
returns boolean. We compare the graduation
year

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.730
of a student to 2011. The

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.530
output of the filter method will be a
subset of

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.550
all the students that we have to start
with, which will

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.710
only be the students who graduated in
the year 2011.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:21.360
We take that subset of data and we pass it to
another method,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.540
this case called map, which uses another

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.060
anonymous inner class

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.110
called Mapper to determine

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.440
how to actually do that mapping, and in this
case

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.850
it has a single method called extract, takes a
student, s,

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.490
as parameter and returns a double. For
this

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.400
we take the collection of students who
graduated in 2011

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.870
and we convert that into collection of records

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.960
of the scores of those students. 
At the end of the map

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.040
we have all the scores of the students
who graduated in 2011.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.230
We pass that collection of data

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:03.870
into what is in effect a reduce
operation, but it's a special form

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.200
of reduce, which is max. It takes all these

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.490
double values and looks at them and detemines
which

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.200
is the highest value and we return that
result as

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.510
our end result. This is good.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.490
This is much better in terms of 
looking at how we can do parallel

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.370
processing,

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.660
how we can use those multicore, multi CPU
machines.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.960
We don't have explicit iteration, there's no

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.670
loop there, so the iteration can be
handled

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.450
internally within the filter or the map
with max method.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.820
That means that if the library code wants to
do that in parallel

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.390
we haven't forced, by defining
filter and map methods,

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.540
we haven't forced an order of execution on that.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.800
Now we're not doing it inherently
serially,

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.080
we can do it in parallel if we want to. We can
also

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.780
apply some other optimizations so that,
if we wanted to, we could do lazy

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:02.990
evaluation,

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.600
we could merge together the filtering and the 
mapping,

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.440
so we did them is a combined operation
on each element as it comes through the

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.130
set of method calls.
Because we don't have

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.920
a variable which we're updating
explicitly here

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.810
we're also thread safe. The client
logic, what we're looking at here

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:28.140
is stateless. The result is generated
internally,

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.370
so we don't have to worry about the
state being modified

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.970
in our

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.150
code. That's great. What's the

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.220
downside? Well, the downside is

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.780
is very simple; its just plain ugly.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.190
What I've done to illustrate that is I've
put some the code in red

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:51.480
and most code in black. The code that's in
red

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.290
is actually what we're really interested in.
We've got a collection of students, we're after the

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.179
highest score,

00:17:57.179 --> 00:18:00.980
we want to filter, we want to test against the
graduation year being

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.419
2011. We want to map, we want to get the score,
we want to max.

00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:07.440
All the rest of it, the fact we're using a
predicate of

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.080
type student, which has a method called op,

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.280
returning a boolean, and so on, is boilerplat code.
We just

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.059
really don't want to have that. That is what

00:18:19.059 --> 00:18:23.049
Lambda expressions are all about; how we
can simplify

00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:26.549
this kind of code in order to make it

00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:31.030
easier to understand. If we rewrite

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.950
the code that we had using Lambda
expressions

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.120
we can see that, suddenly, it becomes much

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.640
simpler. Now what we're 
saying in case of the filter,

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.320
we need to define this single method
called op that

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.080
we have in our Predicate. You can
think about of a Lambda expression at this

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.020
point in time

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.790
as being like a method, but its is not really
a method.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:19:00.799
I'll explain that as we go through other
parts of the lesson. For now think of it being like

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:05.280
a method. It's like the method we saw
in the anonymous inner class

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.730
in the previous slide. For filter we have

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.140
method, who's parameter in this case student s;

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.940
that's the left hand side of the arrow.
The body of the method

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.410
is to return whether the graduation year

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:22.090
is 2011 or not. Immediately, you can
see that

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.200
this this is not like a method as we
used to

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.930
because is no explicit return statement. 
The compiler

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.200
will infer from the fact that we're
comparing graduation year

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.310
to 2011 that the result is going to be a
boolean. Similarly,

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.350
when we look at the map method we're
passing in a Lambda expression.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.740
The left hand side of the arrow is the parameters,
student s,

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.150
the right hand side is the body, which simply
returns

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.900
the score of that student and the compiler
will infer that's a

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.510
double based on the fact that the
signature of getScore

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.840
is to return a double. max doesn't require a

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.400
Lambda expression, so it just turns the
maximum value.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.540
This gives us something that is

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.390
much more readable, so it's more abstract
in terms the approach that we take,

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.640
and because it's much simpler in terms
the the code,

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.720
much less code that we have to look at,
it's much less error-prone.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.850
We don't have to worry about do we get the
type to the method right, do we get the

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:23.250
type of

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.750
generic parameter right. All of those
things

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.080
are done for us by the compiler, so we have a
much simpler way of

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:37.140
looking at the code when we want to do this
kind of thing.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.930
To summarize section one of this lesson,

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:45.300
we needed changes to the Java language
not just to the API's,

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.480
so that we could simplify how we could
deal

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.470
with parallel coding. What

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.780
Lambda expressions really gives us is

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.200
a very simple way now to be able to
pass

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.740
behaviour as a parameter to a method.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.260
We've had that in the past in terms of
anonymous inner classes, but

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.560
because of this rather verbose syntax

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.080
it's always been very difficult to use
that effectively. Now we have a
350
00:21:14,080 --&gt; 00:21:15,010
simple way

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.950
to past behavior as a parameter as well
as values,

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.420
because most the time we pass values as
parameters.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.940
Now we can pass behavior as well and we
can also sign behavior

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.180
to a variable if we want to. That

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.300
is the end of part 1 of this

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:34.800
lesson.
