 swing to do some more fancy stepped leather 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.830
 and can also be dynamic loading or fashionable like that 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.930
 for that stalk and again bass leader song 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.790

 yes a love interest in toppix is 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.320
 nice epilepsy 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.960
 in this mixture our wit and models' 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.450
 mean such an excisting garth as we do 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.450
 embarrassing module get neck you talk about 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.150
 tomorrow you're with for now we're going to 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.000
 focus on this world and who jeff models' 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.210
 zoey kinget can be the best 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.850
 modul-system and ulcer wine specific 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.670

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.590
 worry set to the beginner stick with and 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.700

 in pfm mojo 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.500
 correction in this case the view more 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.019
 jobs again you decorate model f analysis 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.900
 make your mojo studies smarter 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.060
 the tokens wants the sealine model and this 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.319
 case and nice cote 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.870
 is provided by the en alice model and the 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.590
 first in shifts purpose is on purpose 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.790
 so sealine model will express esso wd 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:47.000
 requires statement that i want to use 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.470

 de en alice is model s drug prestige 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.870
 because the export is pacific package and is 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.170
 kees die and alice that is ep ai beckers 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.209
 so only 'buy in the analysis by the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.819
 fbi package will be visible 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.970
 my other models feature which require 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.630
 this model alarm pictures or just 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.650
 invisible war for other models 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.480
 zoë get encapsulation here again 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.850
 simplify contract for deep 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.670

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.109
 at private ielts private message with it 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.109
 th and or classes 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.459
 authors the set accessible with a de 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.489
 cfnm 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:41.840
 reflection napier and have to participate 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.250
 is that open now hey it beckers like that 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.799
 is open 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.470
 similar but absolutely lemonade cms export 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:51.889
 and in some cases this makes sense to 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.840
 boat export and taupe and packers 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:58.269
 you will export for kompot imaxys and you 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.459
 opens for runtime deep reflection nexus 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.379
 7 set in fur short intro as a result 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.879
 and let me down to more interesting stuff 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.269
 services 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:11.700
 so let's say they share this 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.439
 application in this application will be 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.350
 great to use for several times demos 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.750
 today it is text in alice's 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.769
 application you know party is such a text 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.760
 in dui 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.610
 basically and you can use his algorithm 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.530
 and cook complex is that on the 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.550
 text that you p it's an int you the and 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.229
 interview wine and will i will tell you 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.050
 some less thick and most calculé 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.680
 so ever mix and study fund 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.169
 again in him support is in this case 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.150
 epic asian ass beauté du wie nec yoline 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.630
 so tough is the throw that application 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.970
 and and so looking have our power 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.539
 design degree in an ornamental line must jos 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.550
 she just know about the epa or analyzers 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.770
 or text analyzers 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.470
 they don't care about what's the fun 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.539
 about rhythms and art decor supporter 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.460
 thor 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.110
 now another box of people come up or 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.979
 leave retirement and care about that should 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.560
 use their body analyzer epa 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.330
 with and lurking and that really so 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.400
 implementations of te or de of the air 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.110
 analyzer sweeper feyenoord at 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.770
 to war memorial sikkink a model and me 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.770
 come in the mojo 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.669

 boat show of the costs that would be 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.470
 time link to action to to the 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.470
 actual implementations 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.330
 with an erection each put the in speakers 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.729
 just now encapsulation denies who 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.180
 course of to guide again wonders 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.800
 and hairstyle eight hour implementation sometimes 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.870
 see if that analyzer show in this case 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.820
 the pin chain analyzer who do not want 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.050
 to share this implementation with other 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.030
 more you directly at the financiers et 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.810
 who can yell taxi and instance or 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.900
 functional 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.270
 or sisters implementation so who who who who 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.370
 especially there is and there is the one to run 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.050
 this could be left to export over 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.400
 implementation at there is of course 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.400
 ron is not worry want 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.000

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.790
 the gibsons is this is kai or whatever 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.910
 springwood contain views and xml big 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:32.200

 picas to the bank reserve model 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.670
 think app solutions as object runtime 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.400
 that's jp and so in this case you have to 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.530
 we open our package which is a little 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.600
 bit better than and export maybe with it 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.320
 silent dream it quiet I just had not 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.320

 the office x company knowledge bierie a 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.130
 vent it but i have a new purpose 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.810
 in Japan you can do your fishery course with 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.790
 mojo 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.760
 so you know what I am an express with services 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:13.450
 is a nice and also an expert status 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:16.960
 users a certain interface is a shirt 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:19.630
 and service interface and this is on purpose 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.810
 in the mojo a photo hotel is the de 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:25.390
 model system and then our implementation 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:30.790
 model scamper or flight implementations 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:33.510
 that interface and do in action first 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.500
 race for being so this is our kind watched 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.420
 implementation million 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.720
 and those for free in the implementation apps 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:43.270
 to do is pro fight the analyzer 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:48.070
 interface white t-shirt and 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:50.680
 implementation class that sets and looking 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:54.850
 at the service service so the plinth yes 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:58.570

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:08.080
 is right plant yes and the nijs 

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.780
 thing is that using this service model 

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.700
 disc was that is not after the export like that 

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.560
 week and edge touring car selection or 

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.770
 these classics is an implementation 

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.770

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.970
 just because the consume this service

 so ruby ​​a front door greensight to whom 

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:33.370
 use the interface or analyzer who don't

 older implementation model 

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:53.140
 you just have to require the jps works 

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.160
 pressing the users to use constraints 

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.530

 implementations this of which both 

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.510
 service needed and we ran it over 

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:07.090
 it and start using them like that too 

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:09.100
 a list this kid ridge racer on all the 

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:13.330

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.880
 implementation you want youth like that 

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:25.540
 using the stream and providing a filter 

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:27.130
 round the classroom or implementation like that 

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.990
 week and do winter introspection 

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.490
 reflection napier when classf free 

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.980
 sample has the check 

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.660
 average specific and notation that were 

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.910
 interested in 

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.580
 anonymous implementation that for me a 

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:42.430
 grading in again and again 

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:45.010
 that you are silent then not access to the actual 

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:49.270
 implementation touch zoey do that 

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:52.060
 time coupling wit old provider and the 

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:56.620
 consumer with the extreme in niceday very 

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:58.900
 very clean power for men and arneis 

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.850
 things tibet complete for freyr is that 

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.190
 you can be really new and analyzers 

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.750
 me basily boys calling in a new one 

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:08.040
 john paul 

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:09.640
 evie and powder new new joyfull 

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.290
 want a new one 

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.750
 implantation on an analyzer one hour 

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.460
 module pad is we keep with i walked i 

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.550
 there at the system at startup 

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:21.580
 so the startup will still be dynamic 

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:23.650
 be doo be found and roll band so daddy 

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.720
 business user interface with outs none 

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.960
 do not sing cold the aviation pole of 

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.960
 marlon 

00:10:28.439 --> 00:10:33.749
 the pine force white think god i 

00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:36.269
 know this 

00:10:33.749 --> 00:10:38.549
 the pens shen zhen from be using a user 

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:40.649
 jump from way to achab all those 

00:10:38.549 --> 00:10:43.499
 services ai that knowledge seems to me 

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:45.419
 injector whatever you're using my way 

00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:48.019
 for those which watchers in the in room 

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:48.019
 with us 

00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:52.639
 target was winterstop airfryer 

00:10:53.039 --> 00:11:01.349
 with barry thickest the red solex look at 

00:10:57.299 --> 00:11:03.839
 and using use in star or services 

00:11:01.349 --> 00:11:05.789
 lets let you just a few water bottle windows 

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:06.509
 services who of use picasso seems to me 

00:11:05.789 --> 00:11:09.989
 ate in jackd 

00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:12.599
 and this can be a physiological but you if 

00:11:09.989 --> 00:11:14.999
 you another user and what is looking for a 

00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:18.139
 few minutes 

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:21.329
 with ben when you think you can get to 

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:23.339
 and provide your implementation in one 

00:11:21.329 --> 00:11:24.599
 model in the deuce mojo 

00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:26.429
 and this can cease looks like this 

00:11:24.599 --> 00:11:27.239
 is not yes from me specifically you just 

00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:31.079
 plain 

00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:33.359
 juice show all our common implementation 

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:37.229
 extension effect model with you seriously 

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:39.599
 class and this is possible or telstar and toe mind ' 

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:43.279
 the analyzer interface to my 

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:43.279
 analyzer implementation class 

00:11:45.029 --> 00:11:50.699
 well my consumer must be able to come 

00:11:47.729 --> 00:11:54.149
 Paul I offered mojo interviews 

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:55.499
 and and for use to be able to is magic 

00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:57.449
 but implementation pack is like him 

00:11:55.499 --> 00:12:00.149
 study open that register in the end user 

00:11:57.449 --> 00:12:03.899
 reflection to the grade in his sister or 

00:12:00.149 --> 00:12:06.389
 this or so implementation 

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:09.569
 so this is a swilling icepeak 

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:13.519
 restore your soul and expo ring is on 

00:12:09.569 --> 00:12:15.899
 Jos Beckers coming juice and that's right 

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:17.609
 disco choice is going to big deals 

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:19.409
 the actual implementation 

00:12:17.609 --> 00:12:23.519
 thanks sharing can also be killer 

00:12:19.409 --> 00:12:25.799
 afterwards a lot of costs became anne 

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:29.069
 consuming stylish and bigger prime that 

00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:32.519
 karsten be able to or create my 

00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:33.989
 youth context f executive effexor chair 

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:35.929
 box of moguls 

00:12:33.989 --> 00:12:37.049
 and that superfly model with me 

00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:39.029
 implementations 

00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:39.750
 sony texas term mojo come into my 

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:43.110
 chin looked at me 

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:45.510
 here then to be able to push the 

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:49.140
 application and natural amika fast and 

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:53.130
 require the actual implementation 

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:55.140
 moguls and an action requiring the 

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:57.630
 implementation goodies 

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.800
 just implementation silent or actively 

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.230
 encapsulated 

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:05.100
 we now have such a link between 

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:08.310
 the sea life of joy marshall and the 

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.320
 actual implementation of my analyzers 

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:14.490
 this is not very clean this is not 

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:18.060
 furnies which is necessary because one 

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:20.610
 you a or mechanical or abus ministers 

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:26.220
 creation bits you need loretta 

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:26.880
 effect mojo butt we distinction place a 

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.550
 channel 

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:34.080
 apple 'us ate me in jackd so you make 

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:37.790
 some people you prefer to have lessons like this 

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.930
 steak loupe two action this so the coleman 

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.600
 implementation million 

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:44.910
 grace in finding this training this 

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:48.470
 effect model which is basically 

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.470
 yet again when the deuce fbi 

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:54.930
 arsi lions de is our consumer care to 

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:58.800
 require this use my job to be able to 

00:13:54.930 --> 00:14:00.240
 bushcraft using the application that it 

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.360
 can create in injector 

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.330
 and gam talking to us epa that just how a 

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.310
 us coast guard becomes en van der wal un 

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:11.640
 in jackd 

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:15.030
 but your mike rowe axel implementations 

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.500
 so wf mostly clean encapsulation 

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:21.150
 resources within more link linking 

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:24.600
 for more action because that's how peridis come white 

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:26.250
 services and one the ettin jack disco 

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.589
 lights rights and that's what a lovely 

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:31.380
 blog familiar with and if you formal 

00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:33.300
 widgets you might still be men used at 

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.120
 with whom do see he salutation 

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:38.370
 marcoplein than who it wit services and 

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.030
 also be awesome e-coach and sister vr tool 

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.810
 change our 

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:44.670
 a million info to get new 

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.260
 implementations or analyzers 

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.290
 and we service 'girlfriend have him and 

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.999
 that coach answers 

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:54.089
 so pi combiner tout that mine 

00:14:50.999 --> 00:14:55.259
 legs in dressing approach but i still 

00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:56.670
 because is checking in 

00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:59.040
 can you from i gary air is spray 

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:02.160
 coupling between my zeolite 

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:04.649
 and my implementation mojo because I see 

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:09.059
 customize won 

00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:11.339
 so white borrowed gary this is for export or 

00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:12.899
 the packers this content my youth effect 

00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:15.059
 mojo 

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:16.529
 and in deathbed again profiling is service 

00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:19.170
 profiling and frank marshall again soon 

00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:20.819
 and his service 

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:23.189
 so effect model and therefore cases our 

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:25.379
 interface chips interface and sexy and 

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:29.309
 natural asparagus fine 

00:15:25.379 --> 00:15:32.819
 and down and profiling it wit ar actual 

00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:36.619
 million a soyuz model 

00:15:32.819 --> 00:15:39.149
 representing already there will be implementation 

00:15:36.619 --> 00:15:41.670
 or the consuming site 

00:15:39.149 --> 00:15:44.850
 week and also in white or this requires and 

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:50.429
 instead of that we just use at flex 

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:52.050
 model is a service to 

00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:55.350
 so we just gray the place in the weekend 

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:58.019
 injector white service loot loot effect 

00:15:55.350 --> 00:16:00.839
 model that class nfi things working in 

00:15:58.019 --> 00:16:02.670
 such an am i combine services and the program 

00:16:00.839 --> 00:16:05.279
 in matteus 

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:07.740
 and this weekend has the benefit of 

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:10.529
 it checks in and because that is possible on my 

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:12.179
 seat next to the use which i k3 daughter 

00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:14.899
 that link to this might be an 

00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:14.899
 interesting approach 

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.929
 art m singers drawing is come here frank 

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:23.069
 look at what were designed to be 

00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:26.490
 that we shows is after the voice success 

00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:29.850
 Dekkers keeps boxing core off oh hai 

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:32.040
 French is there so bye oh okay sal 

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:34.439
 wheels of paul love week and approach 

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.480
 means design in the margin so how much 

00:16:34.439 --> 00:16:38.670
 work together should be how we can 

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.670
 either use services and service lead to 

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:43.889
 create the couple the coupling between 

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:45.299
 provider consumers or services 

00:16:43.889 --> 00:16:47.429
 your channel stands still use your own 

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:49.079
 the penis in jackson framework 

00:16:47.429 --> 00:16:51.540
 do you have what you do you can anyway 

00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:52.230
 was a reacher he fell wrong 

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.190
 quiet 

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.380
 I enjoyed the 

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.310
 the mechanical services or also one 

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.830
 packages 

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.670
 the thatcher dennis is perf double 

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.560
 and 

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.900
 great great your structure and module ratio 

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.640
 application is turned off because it is the name 

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.400
 the look and more at sound design 

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.500
 principles for marshall even vote that way 

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.900
 what not the thinking bout but you go 

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:15.569
 to create marshalls are everyone 

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:18.600
 application or her or so lovely often 

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:21.720
 are many people the valley blue is there 

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:26.250
 so a review and who won dystopia 

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:29.040
 module and soon as possible so and heroes 

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:31.050
 first of all and this might be and pray 

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.910
 surprising the 

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:35.340
 the resin thing extreme mojo benefits 

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:37.410
 is clothing is no 

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.750
 and as you see in the marshall 

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:42.300
 descriptors sjofar de nature import 

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.610
 right to use them in 

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.680
 is an argument you require so expensive 

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:49.770
 effects free part or the epa and 4 

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.520
 million or your changer you take the 

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.920
 fact marshall 

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.350
 sorry can do it just so down your cock 

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.800
 wild of forever 

00:17:55.350 --> 00:18:01.410
 for snakes short million and I am 

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:04.530
 Richard Wright by committing scenarios 

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:06.120
 here and the firth man is just you one 

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.160
 application level 

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.680
 for example, it is an operation skin 

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.350
 easy text becomes that far 

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.600
 then you would like you take root 

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:18.780
 studies about short and memorable 

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.280
 sure point and who tried to die by 

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.590
 using the 

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.230

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.920
 his component take a third marshall 

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.750
 represents 

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.940
 here on location for simple it is 

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.220
 however google that sila 'jordi is text 

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:35.490
 in all systems such as afar so dieser 

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:37.320
 art night you go short and more furniture 

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.680
 marshall agree 

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:43.400
 however if you are adver-online library 

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:46.440
 maintainer tanks and quite different 

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:50.340
 lucas where is there application marshalls 

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:52.650
 arm those people be used as a dedication 

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.360
 julia in the early dream angels' arm and 

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.120
 to bios tutor and ties that of the 

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:59.400
 applications was like people 

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.010
 so third of could strange air from the mojo 

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.640
 No 

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:07.090

 that you were used for peace opinion 

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.500
 so if you have my brico sar ran into your 

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.780
 company you something like because my 

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.960

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:23.650
 library uniquely identifiable 

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:25.780
 I still walk and I want to help and 

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.520
 for conflict there for example 

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:30.310
 several open source packages 

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.900

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:37.330
 jeroen be able to use and together 

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:40.060
 education and dads stay that way 

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:42.790
 use reverse dns emotional seaview ring 

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.890
 light breeze and a good know this before 

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.870
 take a martial in a la brea 

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.760

 package of your library 

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:53.050
 so so this is between the long sash 

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:56.890
 graphics between all pages and you're a 

00:19:53.050 --> 00:20:00.180

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:11.440
 top-level ideal so well that we well that we 

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.880
 not a hefty build one or the 

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.730

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:28.180

 fine if i implanted those photos

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:56.000
 german herring cycle own charlie 

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.800
 dimensions 

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.030
 is really bad bright eyes guillaume 

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.520
 gillet 

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:04.580
 copy can be harder sustains him once 

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:07.309
 get rid of the risks in the whiles 

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.910
 that he is easy to remember 

00:27:07.309 --> 00:27:10.610
 for a bit 

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:11.630
 between the food jar file lombard le 

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:15.350
 dieu surprise box 

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:18.260
 pico's curriculum authors marshalls 

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:20.270
 cannot be restarted your knowledge is so 

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:23.090
 happens if you left to share from as 

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:27.410
 like here office and books and play 

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:29.300
 button to create roots half is josh 

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.440
 therefore work because 

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:34.550
 marshalls can has sugar cane 

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:38.120
 appendices is how you can become 

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:40.550
 two baby cycles is called death 

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.170
 note from god to structure at 

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:44.840
 kris berry that becomes deep and sum 

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:47.870
 crossing the satellite appendices 

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:49.370
 the les inspecting sample here how u hp 

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:52.490
 what is marjo a book-smart boy in the 

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:54.620
 type above and then michelle and i have to 

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.300
 I with the code erase every address in one 

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.740
 in this house a list of books 

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.370
 this is how the tendency to test the books 

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:04.160
 million and on the other hand 

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:06.230
 who he wore and deadly first to offer 

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.550
 so here is that guy for seitlich 

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:10.940
 vanishing 

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:13.640
 now why this book cover with reference 

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:16.040
 about this issue and dominance times 

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.880
 heard January because that fans and what 

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.400
 about breaking your husband 

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.860
 the syco and the left or right side management 

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:25.100
 wiessee this book and they shrink functions 

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:28.610
 and use the everywhere need to get no to 

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:32.530
 print and is pointers two and abstraction 

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:35.860
 this is machines case and disinfection 

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:37.870
 let's go let's take so take is min 

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.240
 TVs 

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:44.080
 abstraction unfortunately is to create and 

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:46.720
 interface that the offer and in talent and 

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.220
 it is quiet that you have a water with water 

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.710
 your name is justin mettingen 

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.470
 santing or which takes interface and the 

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:55.750
 takes interface to lies and books 

00:28:53.470 --> 00:29:00.070
 that's how it becomes a series of exercises 

00:28:55.750 --> 00:29:01.480
 as far as they are full of office books and so do you 

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.190
 deep and from fresh a throw-in 

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.590
 I was taking the oil brain out 

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:07.840
 interface the course interest in my sister 

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:10.780
 transplantation 

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.640
 so so interface love in the books 

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.290
 the boost marshall name and so on 

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.490
 do not take you deep and then take rack no 

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.390
 cycle 

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:18.670
 but they have next to think that 

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:22.150
 happens here is that who doesn't need 

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:24.700
 to expose the office or relationship 

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:25.720
 anyone who takes the implements wreath 

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.730
 in the meat 

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:30.010
 free page to the books marshall your ear 

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:30.820
 dinos take out interface so this is 

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:34.090
 ow 

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:36.760
 using spf action using just jane brand 

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:38.740
 sphinx how you know about java 

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.330
 it is this greeley relay d'études 

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:43.060
 marshall sister bright is x plus q 

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:44.770
 design and evia ply did after week and break 

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:47.800
 the cycles and recreate 

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:50.080
 roots out of the joys it in chili 

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.980
 herd that measures in the margins 

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:55.630
 well this is course something that 

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.760
 takes ever think about this is not 

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.870
 something that you can medley you 

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.060
 in the winnie the pants another 

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:02.650
 action coach you must have width cycle 

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.330
 its meme cooler than i previously wire where 

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.040
 is a recurring put that takes 

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:08.950
 interface in an e-piano driver 

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.140
 simple this roll design cupboard no sit you 

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:14.160
 even think about which makes sense 

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.160
 what makes sense in your application 

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:20.190
 well that was you or a c and you 

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.660
 mostly see this and frameworks is that 

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:24.330
 Was or coach salutation optional and that 

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:28.380
 precise of code 

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:31.049
 inhaling jobs well I do now requires a 

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:33.210
 request trends that china million that 

00:30:31.049 --> 00:30:35.070
 agree that that band see is there both at 

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:37.950
 be a companion and their garden 

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:39.059
 such an application live stars or the marjo 

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:42.539
 that is mentioned in an hour 

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:44.970
 requires a door well I don't hear 

00:30:42.539 --> 00:30:46.350
 do because not shown the tennessee zoey 

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.659
 because the using cycled by many farmers 

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:52.200
 garden message not give it a great and 

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:53.970
 were used on beyond choice what you can 

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.130
 doing is use 

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:58.799
 head what scores comes pole time money that 

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:01.409
 pens cissé and come from hemp oil that 

00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:04.320
 pen shark spreads would require strong 

00:31:01.409 --> 00:31:05.220
 upc sam a framework mayonnaise and 

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.190
 require strong 

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:11.789
 stuck jason lips and what's on purpose 

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:14.880
 that and men's frameworks tardis 

00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:17.279
 just vansation I walked is in it 

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:20.159
 profits use it is most is marshall to be 

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:22.440
 linked to the framework marjon 

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:24.389
 we this is the model that mind you will 

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:28.019
 just one significantly 

00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:29.100
 name so give potential for 

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:30.929
 runtime exceptions 

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:33.360
 will you become something that I really want to 

00:31:30.929 --> 00:31:34.769
 avoid wise and that's also something 

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.960
 that 

00:31:34.769 --> 00:31:38.730
 marshall system should avoid the 

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.850
 cosmology and soccer configuration with 

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:44.730
 ambar sorry script is now this means 

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:47.010
 that a framework not your korey that fancy 

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.600
 foil and services use reflection 

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.549
 two instantiate types from the 

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.710
 optional deep and simikos you know it 

00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:55.380
 retirement that is chair 

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.549
 because it might not be there and even i 

00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:00.659
 use reflection 

00:31:56.549 --> 00:32:01.409
 first gladly coat seq forward for this 

00:32:00.659 --> 00:32:04.559
 is a review 

00:32:01.409 --> 00:32:07.649
 guys there it is 

00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:10.320
 what you see first german on it yet 

00:32:07.649 --> 00:32:12.809
 dimensions acquaintances or kempische or 

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:15.029
 using it he now determines the tights 

00:32:12.809 --> 00:32:17.039
 we then modeled the beds on you and called 

00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:18.450
 and cissé is the us the services that 

00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:21.149
 broth release a 

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:23.220
 zoë be really bad there is for the 

00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:25.380
 framework to express deep and see on 

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.240
 some interface that someone we seriously 

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.200
 many users' constraint for simple users 

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.539
 jason deadline 

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.649
 jason and then it can use the service 

00:32:30.539 --> 00:32:34.950
 loader edgar 

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:37.380
 to care and implications of this jason 

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:39.690
 and service interface I can provide you a filter 

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:42.679
 dam influence to find the force one 

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:45.000
 closet there that they were pulled him out 

00:32:42.679 --> 00:32:47.340
 and there is not there then the framework 

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.760
 and just to be for back and vis der 

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:53.970
 centuries right so that is much cleaner we 

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.529
 laptopshop.be becomes tights for two hours 

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:59.340
 there is also bit more phase of course 

00:32:55.529 --> 00:33:02.190
 pico's you exki well nothing that 

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:03.570
 margry that provides the french this their 

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.970
 temptation to be 

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:09.240
 service waiter too heavy provides cloud 

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:12.419
 for this case not face and i am one 

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:14.760
 pore set and services arns realize you 

00:33:12.419 --> 00:33:15.510
 girl i wish i can see this oil import 

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.019
 and provence 

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:21.169
 quite a third role of services anyway 

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:21.169
 increase 

00:33:23.309 --> 00:33:27.960
 well then last thing there must be someone 

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.429
 manage the hoisting d'huez 

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:33.720
 dynamically draw coast am and 

00:33:29.429 --> 00:33:36.299
 dynamically reward mediums that chance 

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.279
 lots of people think this is something 

00:33:36.299 --> 00:33:39.720
 that shows comes from the law book for free 

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:43.289
 wi-fi music system 

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:44.039
 I was for him while you are in that 

00:33:43.289 --> 00:33:45.510
 thousand 

00:33:44.039 --> 00:33:46.860
 this santing that nothing who was baking then 

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:49.110
 motion system I have someone make him ethical 

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:51.389
 hacking and 

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:54.299
 ems min meet part or this year from mojo 

00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:57.360
 system is true in addition way and 

00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:59.250
 then you might expect so lets inspexx 

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:03.419
 becomes happens 

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:05.820
 there are epa goals and you will become marjoram 

00:34:03.419 --> 00:34:08.220
 don't know what you will love this is 

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:11.550
 that every application that you write 

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:14.550
 using marshalls xlii live in a million 

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:15.690
 members both marshalls that you put the 

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.879
 margin on 

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:20.310
 will eventually and village and real-time in 

00:34:17.879 --> 00:34:22.889
 becoming scholes the blood they learn the 

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:25.020
 a lot here contains this one perishes 

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:27.179
 marshall steroid design of the macho 

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.980
 talk with our ass to narrow margins 

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:31.980
 download from the pure platform 

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:36.089
 platform itself a jerry can 

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:37.850
 well this needs your layer 

00:34:36.089 --> 00:34:40.370
 he is such a practical 

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:42.620
 and marlies is practical that is in 

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.730
 several so you can not at new 

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:47.480
 marshalls 

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:52.070
 so nice app winter you need any time 

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:53.810
 you can make marshalls yourself with sure 

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.460
 in doing this there is an attempt at it 

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:57.740
 until tomorrow 

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.330
 well put that caesar boat 

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.800
 application and play from my youth it 

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.320
 preferably in live blood layer and the euro 

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.180
 rudolf together and they have all the 

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.560
 guarantee soft modules in the right zo der 

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.050
 nut cycles in their 

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:12.350
 and I am sustainable and missing is claire 

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:13.340

 financial bocouture 

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:48.900
 and server order garth and this will be 

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:51.329
 with main barriers county be 

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:54.000
 constructs sways to 

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:55.740
 well you can do is seafood so you have to 

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.589
 download you need a new layer 

00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:00.990
 no ex look at my flash 

00:38:58.589 --> 00:39:02.099
 more and then you can calculate your can 

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:03.720
 therefore see here 

00:39:02.099 --> 00:39:09.170
 calculate such a complex kind to the 

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:09.170
 stacks turkish and me one in the bus 

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:13.260
 known the cm for other 

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.170
 and cottages where I have the next one 

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.670
 system also so we are now also a bed 

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:21.539
 now is your chance i set tool dropdown 

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:23.789
 is dynamic 3a drenthe just this 

00:39:21.539 --> 00:39:26.039
 years of mosul systems support and am me 

00:39:23.789 --> 00:39:28.670
 home or coat all you after work for 

00:39:26.039 --> 00:39:31.770
 future use the marshall layer you have 

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:33.539
 show such a drink little bit or something like that 

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:36.180
 he becomes him here is mine 

00:39:33.539 --> 00:39:37.410
 grow marjon so module info and 

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:41.819
 dress code 

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:43.049
 the main coach and between first service 

00:39:41.819 --> 00:39:45.059
 lead that lead 

00:39:43.049 --> 00:39:47.099
 was to restart the application download 

00:39:45.059 --> 00:39:49.049
 service provider Marianne Morsche instead 

00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:51.599
 so week becomes an empty god to whoever had 

00:39:49.049 --> 00:39:53.609
 need service loaders back with that 

00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:56.640

 is with ADHD from their bare to a thin 

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:11.870
 layer and if a week effect is layer 

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:14.150
 this is created so is layer is complete 

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:16.460
 can sitting in the house all margins it 

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:17.750
 so nothing is an ebony cycles or object 

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:20.120
 with the mojo system 

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:21.170
