 now usa or the family is starting 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:16.640
 whiskies engineering where do you eat in 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.080
 Carey's engineering seats are immovable 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:25.939
 engineering know just rainer klausmann 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:32.630
 Now my name is motto mine 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:35.260
 name is bond films a yes developer 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:40.070
 network engineer is a lifestyle of 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:44.000
 eccentric builds for years now star of 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.489
 engineering because of so implemented 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.120
 lars many many mystery and patterns mike 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.859
 read write from baxter user circuit 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.960
 breaker a roll on ice cool stuff but 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.140
 not able to cheer trailrunning in 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:06.439
 production and for example fallback boss 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:11.810
 boss roger surprise to implement a case 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:17.150
 Brand Case Michael Forsting alright like 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:21.280
 how startup is using is very jump 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:27.500
 nice okay you as well famous talks of 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:29.750
 jackass star from inception good 1 very 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:37.520
 easy ear and so far together judith 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:47.240
 place in the world and production of 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:48.829
 course i am doing a pretty good job 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.990
 Like how canon gold production like 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.780
 have tried countless unit tests just too 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.259
 test but components most of the time 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.200
 now never happy fits testing and 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.320
 impotent an ogh it is this output 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.439
 appsfire and top of that we're doing 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.180
 integration tests and check-in 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.180
 Components swing up correctly 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.830
 and yes, dealing with the pirate bay 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.830
 lighting when you need is because of them 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.110
 are you able to implement events on 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.930
 very easy and also very zverev are 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.500
 the same tests which staples little 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:36.180
 bit more money more time to the end and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.420
 of course the jobs are sams 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.960
 peschl company is doing so hollow 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.400
 department casting 15 people dead people 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:52.320
 what ever i do it 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.320
 now that's gonna happen maybe we have 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:00.360
 This is a box 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.940
 a quality label to release up and 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.980
 running in production us-author charity 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:15.739
 percent of politicians are tough politicians 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:19.020
 is it coverage hot rod vacation testing 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:23.070
 writing test on-site tests as well as helper 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.310
 sourcecode implementation and now the 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.320
 setting up mutant is a fragrance and 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.150
 implementation and what could be the 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.010
 worst case last test knew how 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.800
 green because we are change 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.520
 implementation what is it is austin 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:46.320
 green 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:48.390
 So sat worst case is many babies 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.430
 and production a very many many 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.739
 questions and our heads for example of 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.630
 implement together read vorbeck immediately 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.380
 easier you in reindeer 3 and in this 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.739
 Instance like yes dettingen a cache

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.430
 santisteban horst so well the container 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.900

 he wanted simple host europe network and 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.070
 was a router switches and of course we 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.470
 have to see what happened when you're 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.759
 strange system center service is 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.539

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:50.919
 storage whatever and publication will 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:56.320
 directly it is cars using a kind of

 okay as hp service discovery for 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:19.780
 example jurica vranjes how instanzen yes 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:23.710
 although the same replicator teenager in 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:26.639
 gettenau is on the service bus 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:31.530
 using small time loadbalancer likely be 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:37.090
 ok where is using with interesting ones 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:41.470
 spring magic i finally we have to save 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:45.880
 our nature still in the data base 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:48.460
 just how pleasing she is with space data 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:55.110
 base in Maryland is best fine 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:57.699
 in a yard estate ag cwi okay so 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.360
 we love to help where help big 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:06.870
 problem is solved a little gold

 only to release the summertime 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:38.149
 as much to do on the way as before 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.990
 the production flows from just to 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:41.529
 they are here 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.529
 Berlin 

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:49.309
 Production and production is nice 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:52.580
 place and maybe baby contacts 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:57.759
 heating water day already very components

 tokio application hosting server server 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:05.509
 runnings coming up and i would run many 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:09.649
 exceptions human resources france 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:13.959
 instance afonso network user blackstone 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:17.240

 a walk in logfiles technologies 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:45.229
 Monitoring tools whatever and special 

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:47.149
 cases your mallorca prices and increased 

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:50.629
 Construction of the story has the post mortem 

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:56.240
 analyzers not about the patients 

00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:58.179
 are the so welper okay so this 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:02.169
 on distributed computing 

00:07:58.179 --> 00:08:05.439
 you can almost see many of them here 

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:12.860
 networks is now reliable as a running 

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:17.599
 very good communications network 

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:21.740
 luther no band firewalls exchange for

 applications or jobs are running for 

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:17.260
 our most of the major wars at once and 

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.930
 running to working but because they are 

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.660
 very body and sale in the trees 

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:28.000
 Consumption in the band for the internet 

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:31.120
 world at host europe network is for 

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.210
 most of the time to secure the

 cosmic sports bfm is it on 

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:46.270
 Configuration updates b have some nice 

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:49.180
 edmonds yes then configuration as well as have 

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:52.390
 to admit that means the battle operation 

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:56.190
 so you're getting firewall 

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.190
 activated by first and second source 

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:06.090
 technologies and change router can 

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:09.280
 want to regret be replaced know how 

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:14.010
 Replays from established but a very 

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.010
 little components and the moving overtime

 my favorite csu never wanna et mettmanns 

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:29.520
 you have to cooperate with mad men 

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.990

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:41.210
 either build this glove before glove 

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.710
 paz 1 and would like to spin up new 

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:49.450
 will understand that the good room 

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:56.870
 in changwon so network whatever the way 

00:10:49.450 --> 00:11:01.730
 we have been allowed to bring cup in 

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:04.940

 account wars disabled foreword proven 

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:30.890
 so, so go with little begging 

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:35.000
 she internally and externally admins transport 

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:38.470

 of action using the availability 

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:46.490
 establish components so first bill is 

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.500
 most beautiful picture of the established

00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:01.930
 bring down the cloud 

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:05.240
 local and communication gateway services 

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:08.650

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:11.570
 communicator back onto the services 

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:13.630

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:17.480
 a piece of discovery and service cover 

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:22.040
 to the applications to the state of the 

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:25.550

 Configuration is never so great 

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:38.089
 able gateway instance service is kari 

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:42.819
 is up and running yes but i can not wait 

00:14:38.089 --> 00:14:45.199
 to the state of things is still so nice 

00:14:42.819 --> 00:14:47.109
 but you would like to know what this 

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:55.839
 case engineering so let's get started 

00:14:47.109 --> 00:15:00.049
 what is engineering news is very yes and 

00:14:55.839 --> 00:15:02.929
 The cables had vibrant chaos there 

00:15:00.049 --> 00:15:09.559

00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:47.360
 have done architect the architect change 

00:15:41.059 --> 00:15:51.309

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:09.659

 Cooperation platform like sony about you 

00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:57.130
 so could experiment together you can

 skip to the end son so rosy from monkey 

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:05.250

 want to be part of europe yes 

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:14.889

 collins does endpoint protector trials 

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:57.580
 and with all sorts throw latency it should 

00:32:55.929 --> 00:33:03.970
 so you can in fact latency and 

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:08.710

 and finally very skeptical if so 

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.460
 it's on the ball is calling the specific 

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.360

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:25.900

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:30.400

 One would be the liverpool startpage 

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:32.020
 so let's get started fingers crossed the 

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:34.840
 Judge the sap of a calling 

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:38.890
 startpage evokes island and so offered 

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:47.250
 so you got in cologne to see the page 

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:49.450
 and our other products from the system dfb 

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:53.530
 post requests to the fashion and 

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:56.200

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:59.140
 Configuration on the fly level one's 

00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:04.300
 apple request to the specific instance 

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:08.140
 wants to act in the space agency as well 

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:15.400
 in jacking latency between five 

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:24.700
 seconds to value based application 

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:27.970
 gateway bernauer let's check what our 

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:30.550
 passion service wants to be responding 

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:33.090
 this back end fashion service station 

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:36.000
 service ag 

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:43.500
 exactly before sensation services approach 

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:47.340
 correctly loud koller startpage sets 

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:50.430
 uses so well last weekend instance so 

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:54.860
 big latency and getting back after five 

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:57.600
 seconds in the duet much better and numbers 

00:35:54.860 --> 00:36:02.010
 exchange configuration of kers monkey 

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:04.380
 you were able to sally configuration at 

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:07.800
 one time for in this case with which of 

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:11.520
 latency which is now the activated to 

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:15.240
 exceptions core configure any to any 

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:17.240
 kind of exception kevin selection 

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:33.000
 the has called this message 

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:35.010
 so let's take a look at internet server 

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.010
 error log as well as can do it man 

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:41.840
 but now comes later 

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:45.650
 kompon container here station service 

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.650

 [Music] 

00:36:54.500 --> 00:37:02.060
 but here is the church context 

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:02.060
 action clauses cacs market share 

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:09.450
 Okay, so have many steps 

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:12.300
 fiercely configurator monkey help around 

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:17.750
 much controller offers so let's take a 

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:20.400
 look at the cross platform to wait to 

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:22.710
 design your experiment in jason format 

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.510
 and you can use many different drivers 

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:27.900
 volks traffic light you can user driver for 

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:30.420
 cuba nice to support services to count 

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:32.340
 supports whatever you can do something 

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:40.290
 scenario it in nature 

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:44.220
 so in of course is you in course of whiskey 

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:46.290
 first driver computer users to take 

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:51.030
 it to configure york as a monkey inside 

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:52.680
 it's time for some experiments 

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:57.690
 containers an open container 

00:37:52.680 --> 00:38:00.990
 positively shocked and space up and 

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:02.340
 preparation target chair experiment 

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.800
 is would like to see the gateway 

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:08.790
 component working correctly as one 

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:14.070

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:33.380
 pale radius is without between the

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:44.570
 that started to the environment 

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.570
 [Music] 

00:38:45.750 --> 00:39:01.650
 finally also seed jason statham would have 

00:38:52.080 --> 00:39:03.210
 you so you can describe experiment you 

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:06.870
 can set up title

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:21.780
