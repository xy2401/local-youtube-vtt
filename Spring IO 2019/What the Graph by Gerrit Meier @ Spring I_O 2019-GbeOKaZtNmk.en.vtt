 weight watchers person like that and have that 

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.780
 motto if you like your configuration 

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:42.340
 functionality we are session factory 

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:45.760
 that's the moment you open it when the

 action express addiction lies down like 

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:05.860
 courses session can be decided 

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:08.799
 but what should be used to the more 

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:12.059
 than one's transaction but it's the 

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:15.059
 possible so you think about the session 

00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:15.059
 sms 

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:28.800
 like obsession, it worked like data 

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:30.900
 either solo to data for the mud 

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:36.990

 a single slot mother before you 

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:44.910
 now working to the point and that is 

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:49.530
 just complex want to see before my 

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:54.930

 still possible and slide principle 

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:07.770
 the armchair statement the not even 

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:12.450
 before the topic just came the person 

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:14.610
 who would need to make the border statement 

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:17.120

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.120
 to force 

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:28.980
 offtopic so if you want to get all yours 

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:32.450
 data that would be image in quality 

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.450
 the costs 

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:13.010
 ok us dollar base because he would say 

00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:16.779
 that is a waterproof project so are you

 case you have used abstraction 

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:39.490
 in some cases complex cases you do not 

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:47.480
 start sets this situation statements 

00:22:44.870 --> 00:23:06.039
 a notebook sound from the project that
