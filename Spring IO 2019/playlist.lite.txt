Yet most developers are waiting for the momentum to take off. You\u2019ve probably heard the theory a couple of times already, but putting it into practice sounds like mom forcing you to eat your veggies. Actually, I love my veggies, so I\u2019ll gladly help you out here. In this session I will demonstrate how you can start using the power of modules in your own application. A Spring Boot application. Because despite the adoption in libraries is not yet great, you can already perfectly make your own application modular. I will guide you through a step-by-step approach to making your application modular. No magic or module-fu is required to achieve this result.

Still, in the course of their life time, modularity and maintainability of monolithic applications very often degrade significantly. This is usually caused by the gap between architectural concepts and the codebase implementing those.\n\nThe talk briefly identifies the commonly observed issues in unstructured monoliths and discusses approaches to code organization and component structure, package design, transactions and the usage of events to implement bounded context interaction. We also take a look at supporting technologies and features of the Spring (Boot) eco-system to easily test individual bounded contexts and detect architectural violations.

We have successfully broken down our application into small and maintainable components. Each individual component can be automated and brought into production at any time. A lot of effort was put into the development to keep the test coverage as high as possible. Every release has to successfully pass our pipeline and countless unit, integration and acceptance tests.\n\nBut why do we have this unpleasant feeling shortly before our arrival at the most beautiful place in the world (production)?\n\nknown unknowns\n\nMany open questions cannot be answered by simple unit or integration tests: 1. will our fallbacks work? 2. does the retry take effect in case of an error? 3. is our Service Discovery up and synchronised? 4. has anyone seen our client-side-load-balancer in action? 5. where\u2019s our database gone?\n\nThis is where Chaos Engineering comes in.\n\nIt helps us to become master of chaos and please do not claim that you are not in chaos! There is a whole industry that sells us ticket systems to document chaos.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nIn this talk you will learn how to introduce Chaos Engineering. Using practical examples, you will learn what can go wrong. At the end of the talk we will conduct a Chaos Experiment in a distributed Spring Boot application. With the help of the Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot we will try to crash the application. But thanks to the implemented Resilience Pattern this won\u2019t work.\n\nYou will take part in the trip to a Cloud-Native Spring Boot application and see how we can automate our chaos experiments.

If the service is scaled horizontally (i.e. there are multiple instances of the same service), you often only want a single node to handle the task.\n\nIn this session I will demonstrate how to manually setup Spring to have custom logic in scheduling configuration and perform recurring tasks only on a single node. This requires keeping notation of the leader and persisting the selection.\n\nThe key takeaway of this session is how to implement distributed locking and how simple it is to run Spring application on top of it.

Like all trendy tech, it can be difficult to distill reality from hype. If you haven\u2019t heard yet, distributed tracing allows you to understand a single request as it crosses an arbitrarily complex (microservice or not) architecture.\n\nThe Apache Zipkin community has helped many new folks understand what is marketing from what is real, leading to numerous site deployments. This session aims to share our \u201cSites\u201d project which is an inventory of real-life setups people use today. These sites employ distributed tracing to increase developer productivity or reduce time in triage.\n\nWhile this will be \u201cZipkin Centric\u201d, it is not exclusively a Zipkin session. Real world sites employ other monitoring systems, log analysis and even other tracing systems to complete their stories.\n\nMeanwhile, applications send data to the tracing system in a myriad of ways. While the best way is implicit tracing such as agents or framework plugins like Spring Cloud Sleuth, reality happens. Sometimes sites use tracing libraries directly, whether they are Zipkin, OpenCensus, OpenTracing or something home grown. We\u2019ll navigate this ecosystem with examples from real sites run by real people. You\u2019ll learn what role is played by what.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you\u2019ll not only learn concrete examples of what tracing is all about, but you\u2019ll also get a connection to the community. We\u2019ll introduce you to the gitter (chat) channel where everyone involved are.

For Spring projects, Gradle and Maven are just two of the tools we can use to help make dependency management easier. They both handle dependency management effectively, but in very different ways. For example, Maven uses BOMs, and, until recently, Gradle didn\u2019t have an equivalent concept. Because of this and other differences, the Spring Dependency Management plugin was created so that Gradle users who already knew Maven could manage dependencies in a way that was familiar to them.\n\nFor earlier versions of Gradle, the plugin\u2019s version enforcement and dependency exclusion features were revolutionary and led to the Spring Dependency Management Plugin\u2019s popularity in the Spring ecosystem and spread to other JVM-based communities such as Android. Now that Gradle 5.X includes native BOM support, users can replace parts of the plugin and take advantage of the productivity gains of the native support.\n\nIn this session, we\u2019ll go over some basic use cases for Gradle native BOM support and show you how to use it to manage the dependencies of a Spring Boot application.

Team A needs for team B to implement and deploy a service, update a service, or figure out why a service isn\u2019t working correctly, this can be a very frustrating process and instead of collaborating you feel like you are competing!
